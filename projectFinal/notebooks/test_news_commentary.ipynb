successful gold investors recently explained to me that stock prices lost their strength more than a decade before the dow jones index crossed the 1000 mark in the early 1980s', 'since then the rate has climbed above 10000', 'now that gold has crossed the 1000 dollar magic barrier why cant it increase ten times as much', 'to think that gold will come at a much higher price is not the leap of imagination that it seems', 'after an increase in inflation todays price is nowhere near the top of january 1980', 'at that time gold reached eightyfive dollars or well above 2000 dollars todays coin', 'but it could be said that january 1980 was an unusual peck during a period of extreme geopolitical unrest', 'todays price 1300 is likely to be more than double the average gold prices adjusted for inflation and very long term', 'what would justify another big increase in gold prices from now on', 'one answer of course is a complete collapse of the american dollar', 'in the face of rising deficits and a fiscal policy without a rudder one does wonder whether a populist administration would recklessly resort to printing', 'and if youre really worried about that gold could really be the most reliable protection', 'some might say that inflationindexed bonds offer better and more direct protection against inflation than gold', 'but gold analysts are right to worry about whether the government will meet its obligations under more extreme circumstances', 'in fact as carmen reinhart and i discussed in our recent book on the history of financial crisis this time is different governments limited by lack of funds will often force themselves to turn unindexed debt into unindexed debt just so that its value can be deflated', 'even the united states abrogated indexing terms in bond contracts during the great depression of the 1930s', 'so it can happen anywhere', 'even so the fact that very high inflation is possible doesnt make it likely so we should be careful when we say that higher gold prices are being driven by inflationary expectations', 'some have instead said that the long rise of gold has been motivated in part by the development of new financial instruments that make it easier to market and speculate with gold', 'this argument is probably somewhat valid and also a certain degree of irony', 'after all the middle ages alchemists were embarking on what we consider today an absurd search for ways to turn base metals into gold', 'wouldnt it be paradoxical then if financial alchemy could make a gold bullion worth a lot more', 'in my opinion the most powerful argument to justify todays high price of gold is the spectacular rise of asia latin america and the middle east in the global economy', 'while legions of new consumers gain buying power and demand is bound to increase bringing up the price of scarce raw materials', 'at the same time the central banks of emerging markets need to build up gold stocks which still have a much smaller share than the central banks of rich countries', 'with the less desirable euro as an alternative to changing from the dollar the attraction of gold naturally grew', 'so yes it could be said that there are solid fundamentals that support todays highest price of gold even though its much more debatable if they will continue to back up higher prices in the future and if so to what extent', 'in fact another critical factor that has been backing up high gold prices can be much more ephemeral than globalization', 'gold prices are extremely sensitive to the movements of overall interest rates', 'after all gold doesnt pay interest and even costs money to store it', 'today with record minimum interest rates in many countries its relatively cheap to speculate on gold instead of investing in bonds', 'but if real interest rates increase significantly as may well happen someday gold prices may plummet', 'most economic research suggests that gold prices are very difficult to predict in the short to medium term being the odds of fairly even gains and losses', 'it is dangerous to infer from shortterm trends', 'true gold has run a big run but the same thing happened with house prices all over the world up to a couple of years ago', 'if you are a wellbacked investmentr a sovereign wealth fund or a central bank it is absolutely sensible to have a modest portion of your wallet in gold as a protection against extreme events', 'but in spite of the extreme charm of gold as a result of an extraordinary increase in its price it remains a very risky bet for most of us', 'of course this kind of consideration could have little influence on prices', 'what was true of the alchemists of the past is still true today gold and reason are often difficult to make up for', '1929 or 1989', 'as the economic crisis expands and expands the world looks for historical similarities to help us understand what has happened', 'at the beginning of the crisis many compared it with 1982 or 1973 which was comforting since both dates marked classical cycle recessions', 'todays moods are much darker and references to 1929 and 1931 are beginning to abound even though some governments continue to behave as if the crisis were more classical than exceptional', 'the tendency is to be overly sloppy europe or to widely spread the measures being taken the united states of america', 'europe is being careful to avoid debt and defend the euro while the us has taken steps on several fronts not to waste an ideal opportunity to put in place urgently needed reforms', 'for the geostrategists however the year that comes to mind naturally in both political and economic terms is 1989', 'of course the fall of lehman brothers has nothing to do with the fall of the berlin wall', 'in fact on the surface it seems to be his perfect antithesis the collapse of a wall that symbolized oppression and artificial divisions in the face of the collapse of a comforting and apparently indestructible institution of financial capitalism', 'however as in 1989 the years 2008 and 2009 may well correspond to a change of era the consequences of which are to be felt for decades', 'the end of the ideological divide between east and west and the end of absolute faith in the markets are historical turning points', 'what happens in 2009 will put at risk some of the positive aspects of 1989 such as the peaceful reunification of europe and the triumph of democratic principles over nationalistic trends if not xenophobic ones', 'in 1989 liberal democracy triumphed over the socialist ideology incarnated and promoted by the soviet bloc', 'for many of his supporters president ronald reagan was the one who by his deliberate escalation in the arms race pushed the soviet economy to the limits thereby showing the superiority of liberal society and the free market', 'of course there are obvious differences between 1989 and today', 'first and perhaps most of all the revolutions of 1989 and the succeeding collapse of the soviet union put an end to global bipolarity', 'by contrast it is likely that the year 2009 will lead to a new form of bipolarity in which china will take the place of the soviet union', 'second while democracy and marketbased capitalism seemed to be the clear victory though more fragile than expected in 1989 with the spread of the global crisis in 2009 it is difficult to distinguish losers from losers', 'everything seems to be losers even though some people look more affected than others', 'however history is unfair and the united states in spite of its greater responsibility for todays global crisis can come out of the mess stronger than most countries', 'as a visiting professor at harvard and mit im getting a good idea of how the world might look once the crisis gets over', 'one feels something like creating a universe dominated by americans and asians', 'from mits incredible media labs to harvards math and economics departments asians chineses and indians in particular are everywhere like the romans in athens in the first century bc full of admiration for those who are learning so much and who could outlive in the decades ahead', 'however before this new order appears the world may face an everdeeper mess if not directly into a mess', 'for example what will happen to a country as central and vulnerable as egypt when hundreds of thousands of egyptians working in the gulf are forced to return to their homeland as a result of the crisis in oilproducing countries', 'when the rich become less rich the poor become poorer', 'what will happen to foreign workers who have arrived at the european dream and today are faced with potential explosions of xenophobia in the supposedly open countries of europe', 'the consequences of 1989 ended up being less lasting than what had been supposed by many watchers including me', 'we can only hope that after all the consequences of 2009 will end up being less painful than the way our intuition and historical reflexes make us feel today', 'the end of 1945', 'on may 8th 1945 when the second world war officially ended in europe much of the world lay in ruins but while the human capacity for destruction knows no limits the ability to start over is equally remarkable', 'maybe thats the reason why humanity has managed to survive so far', 'of course at the end of the war millions of people were too hungry and exhausted to do more than stay alive but at the same time a wave of idealism a sense of collective resolve to build a more equal peaceful and safe world swept through the ruins', 'thats why the great war hero winston churchill lost the election in the summer of 1945 even before japan surrendered', 'men and women had not risked their lives simply to return to the earlier era of class privilege and social deprivation', 'they wanted better housing education and free health care for everyone', 'such demands were heard all over europe where antinazi or antifascist resistance was often led by leftists or in fact communists and prewar conservatives were often stained by cooperation with fascist regimes', 'in countries like france italy and greece the revolution was talked about', 'it didnt happen because neither the western allies nor the soviet union supported it', 'stalin contented himself with having an empire in eastern europe', 'but even charles de gaulle rightwing leader of the resistance had to accept communists in his first postwar government and agreed to nationalize industries and banks', 'the leaning toward the left toward the socialdemocrat welfare states took place all over western europe', 'he formed part of the 1945 consensus', 'in the former european colonies in asia where the native people did not wish to be governed once again by western powers which had been so ignominiously defeated by japan a different kind of revolution was taking place', 'vietnamese indonesians philippines burmeses indians and malays wanted freedom as well', 'those wishes were often expressed at the united nations which was founded in 1945', 'the un like the dream of european unity was also part of the 1945 consensus', 'for a short period many outstanding people albert einstein to name but one believed that only a world government could guarantee world peace', 'that dream quickly faded away when the cold war divided the world into two hostile sides but in some respects the 1945 consensus in the west was reinforced by the cold war policy', 'communism still wrapped in the bay leaf of antifascism had great intellectual and emotional appeal not only in the socalled third world but also in western europe', 'social democracy with its promise of greater equality and opportunity for all served as the ideological antidote', 'actually most democrats were fiercely anticommunist', 'today seventy years later much of the 1945 consensus has not survived', 'few people can make a lot of enthusiasm for the un the european dream is in crisis and every day the postwar social democratic welfare state is being further undermining', 'the decay began during the 1980s with ronald reagan and margaret thatcher', 'the neoliberals attacked spending on social rights programs and the vested interests of trade unions', 'it was believed that citizens needed to gain a better ability to defend themselves state social assistance programs were making everyone soft and dependent', 'according to thatchers famous words there was no socalled society but only families and people who had to take responsibility for their own life', 'but the 1945 consensus received a much bigger blow just as we were all glad of the collapse of the soviet empire the other great tyranny of the twentieth century', 'in 1989 it seemed that the sinister legacy of the second world war the slavery of eastern europe had finally come to an end and so had been in many ways but many more things plummeted with the soviet model', 'social democracy lost its raison dêtre as an antidote to communism', 'all forms of leftist ideas in fact anything that smelled like collective idealism were considered wrong utopism which could only end up in the gulag', 'neoliberalism filled the void creating great wealth for some but at the expense of the ideal of equality that had emerged after the second world war', 'thomas pikettys extraordinary reception of capital in the 21st century shows how deeply the consequences of the collapse of the left have been felt', 'in recent years other ideologies have also emerged to fill the human need for collective ideas', 'the rise of rightwing populism reflects a reverent desire for pure national communities to keep immigrants and minorities out and american neoconservatism has perversely transformed the internationalism of the former left by attempting to enforce a democratic order of the world by means of the us military force', 'the answer to that disturbing evolution is not homesickness', 'we cant just go back to the past', 'too many things have changed but a new desire for social and economic equality and international solidarity is urgently needed', 'it cant be the same as the 1945 consensus but in this new years day we would do well to remember why that consensus came about to begin with', 'what failed in 2008', 'to solve a problem its not enough to know what needs to be done', 'the solution must actually be applied and we must be willing to change course if it turns out that we didnt know as much as we thought', 'thats the message from two recent books that together tell us everything we need to know about the financial crisis of 2008 what caused it what needs to be done to keep it from coming back and why it hasnt been done yet', 'the first book is the shifts and the shocks by british conservative journalist martin wolf which begins by catalogued the important changes that paved the way for the economic disaster that continues to shape todays world', 'his point of departure is the huge increase in wealth between the richest 01 and 001 percent in the world and the attendant pressure on people governments and businesses to become more and more untenable in debt', 'in the meantime the authorities fell in love with the widespread acceptation of economic theories such as the efficient market scenario which assumed that investors acted rationally and relied on all the information available when making their decisions', 'as a result the markets were deregistered making it easy to negotiate claims considered safe but not to be', 'as a result the systemic risk proliferated more than central banks could imagine', 'unproved guesses and eventually incorrect ones created an atmosphere among the authorities marked by what we can only call arrogance', 'the officials underestimated the risks of queues', 'they set inflation targets of about two percent leaving little room for manoeuvring when the water shook and most audacious of all the european union introduced the euro as a common currency', 'in fact long after the crisis began wrong policies continued to be applied', 'the politicians responded to the worsening economic situation by conforming as closely as possible to the prescriptions they had failed seeking to do nothing but what was absolutely necessary to deal with the greatest economic disaster since the great depression', 'wolfs prescription to counter the crisis is simple elegant and irrefutable', 'in the short run he suggested that countries with reserve currencies should spend more money in particular to finance public sector investments and issue more debt', 'according to him his central banks must raise their inflation targets to three percent or even four percent a year', 'in the medium term according to wolf countries need to adopt regulatory measures that reduce debt levels and discourage excessive leverage', 'the eurozone must also solve its internal conflicts either by dissolving or by introducing a minimum set of institutions and policies that would allow the monetary union to function properly', 'wolfs longterm solutions include those to address inequality more global regulation a greater degree of freedom for countries to design their own measures and an economic analysis that is less subject to the freemarket ideologues who addressed the crisis first', 'and no matter how recommendable wolfs proposals may be little has been done to apply them', 'the reasons for this are found in the second book hall of mirrors by my friend teacher and patron barry eichengreen', 'eichengreen attributes the lukewarm reaction to the crisis to the triumph of the monetary economists the disciples of milton friedman over his keynesian and minskyite pairs at least as far as the understandings of the causes and consequences of the great depression are concerned', 'when the 2008 financial crisis broke out the authorities attempted to apply friedmans proposed solutions to the great depression', 'unfortunately it turned out that it wasnt necessary to do that because the monetarist understanding of the great depression was without a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow of a shadow', 'the resulting policies were enough to prevent the 2008 recession from becoming a pure and simple depression but that partial success turned out to be a pyrical victory as it allowed politicians to declare that the crisis had been overcome and the time had come to adopt austerity and focus on structural reform', 'the result is todays stagnant economy which is marked by anaemic growth threatening to become the new normalcy', 'the united states and europe are on the way to throwing away ten percent of their potential wealth while because the regulation of the financial sector has not been tightened the world economy has been exposed to the risk of another major crisis', 'wolf and eichengreen would agree that the major mistakes that caused the financial crisis of 2008 and continue to support our insufficient reaction to it are intellectual', 'in fact the only real lesson that has been learned so far from the crisis seems to be that they will never really take advantage of his teaching', 'my space odyssey', 'most people who have heard of me think im an information technology expert who probably lives in california and invests in risky new internet companies', 'actually my formal residence is in new york city but im about to spend the next five months in russia training to be a cosmonaut in star city on the outskirts of moscow', 'several things came together to make this happen', 'first of all as a child i just assumed that i would go to the moon without having to do much for it', 'i just took it for granted that by the time i was say 40 years old space travel would be a common thing', 'my father was involved in the united states space program and we had some moon rocks at home so for me it wasnt the big deal', 'i was distracted for about 40 years afterwards', 'however a few years ago i began to pay attention back to space', 'many of my it industry acquaintances were doing it as well elon musk cofounder of paypal set up spacex', 'jeff bezos of amazon established a spaceship company called blue origin', 'highlevel management of intel jeff greason founded xcor aerospace which i invested in', 'in 2005 the last year when i held my pc forum conference for it entrepreneurs i started a conference called flight school for space entrepreneurs and private airplanes', 'in the meantime about in 2005 i was in south africa with a small group of people who advised former president thabo mbeki and his government on it policy', 'one of the groups members was mark shuttleworth the founder of thawte who had just come back from a trip where he was the second tourist to visit the space station', 'one afternoon the group was sitting around a campfire while the sun was setting and about 50 children arrived by bus', 'all in all we were about a hundred people including president mbeki around the fire', 'when it got dark a screen was installed and mark showed videos he had taken in space', 'he gave a fascinating talk about his adventures accompanied by shots of him floating and trapping bubbles with his mouth', 'the children loved it and im sure that some of them decided right there to study mathematics and science', 'eventually i invested in space adventures the company that coordinated shuttleworths voyage into space', 'i later attended a tour they organized to witness the launch of charles simonyi the fifth and soon seventh space tourist from baikonur in kazakhstan simonyi wrote the microsoft word program and now has another startup company intentional software and a foundation as well as a website charlesinspaceorg', 'soon afterwards i began talking without giving it too much importance about the possibility of becoming a reserve cosmonaut on the space adventures team', 'yes id love to go but the space travel costs anywhere from 35 to 40 million dollars while reserve training costs just 3 million dollars', 'therefore i had a vague idea that i might go into space sometime in the year of the year that google cofounded sergey brin has planned to go on', 'space adventures was pushing for me to go in 2009 but i was very busy', 'something happened last spring', 'my sister emily had cancer and had a double mastectomie its all right now and shes actually just won a mini marathon', 'a few weeks later i had to deal with one of those conflicts a board of directors over here a conference over there another chance at the same time somewhere else', 'if only i had to have a double mastectomie i could cancel all this and no one would complain', 'i realized that my priorities were the other way around so in some strange way this sabbatical in russia is my alternative to a double mastectomy positive certainly but the same kind of experience of pressing the restart button', 'its also the answer to another question i often hear about my work on human genetics through 23andme www23andmecom and the personal genome project wwwpersonalgenomeorg if you knew you were very likely to have alzheimers disease in a few years what would you do', 'and why wait to know if you can give me alzheimers next month ill write about what it really means to train to go into space', 'september 11th and the new authoritarianism', 'five years after the attacks on the twin towers in new york and the pentagon in washington september 11 is no longer just another date', 'it has come into history as the beginning of something new perhaps a new era but in any case a time of change', 'the terrorist attacks in madrid and london and elsewhere will also be remembered but it is the september 11th that has become a phrase made almost like august 1914', 'but is it really a war that started on september 11 2001', 'not everyone likes this american idea', 'during the height of irish terrorism in the united kingdom successive british governments did their best not to give the eri the idea that war was taking place', 'a war would have meant accepting terrorists as legitimate enemies in a sense equal in a bloody fight where certain rules are accepted', 'this is neither a proper description nor a useful term in the case of terrorist attacks that can best be described as criminals', 'by calling them war and by pointing out an opponent alqaeda and its leader osama bin laden the us government has justified internal changes that prior to the september 11 attacks would have been unacceptable in any free country', 'many of these changes were reflected in the socalled patriot act', 'although some of the changes affected only administrative regulations the overall effect of the patriot act was to encroach upon the great tenets of freedom such as habeas corpus the right to resort to an independent court when the state deprived an individual of his liberty', 'from the beginning the prison in cubas bay became the symbol of something unusual the jail without trial of illegal fighters who are deprived of all their human rights', 'the world is now wondering how many more of these nonhumans are and how many places there are', 'for all the others a type of state of emergency has been declared that has permitted the state to interfere with essential civil rights', 'border controls have become an ordeal for many and police chases now burden a good number of people', 'a climate of fear has made life difficult for anyone who looks suspicious especially for muslims', 'these limitations on freedom were not much opposed by the public when they were adopted', 'on the contrary by far it was the critics and not the ones who supported these measures that were in trouble', 'in britain where prime minister tony blair fully supported the american attitude the government introduced similar measures and even offered a new theory', 'blair was the first to argue that security is the first freedom', 'in other words freedom is not the right of people to define their own lives but the right of the state to limit personal liberty in the name of security that only the state can define', 'this is the beginning of a new authoritarianism', 'the problem exists in all countries affected by the threat of terrorism even though in many countries it has not become so specific', 'in most countries of mainland europe the september 11th is still an american date', 'there is even a debate and indeed some evidence about the question as to whether getting involved in the war on terror has actually increased the threat of terrorist attacks', 'the germans certainly use this argument to keep out of action whenever possible', 'however this position has not prevented something from being extended for what has been taken a word in german angst', 'diffuse anxiety is gaining ground', 'people feel uneasy and worried especially when they travel', 'now any train or plane crash is first suspected of being an act of terrorism', 'therefore september 11th has meant directly or indirectly a great shock both at the psychological level and to our political systems', 'while the fight against terrorism is carried out in the name of democracy it has in fact led to a marked undermining of democracy due to official law and popular anxiety', 'one of the disturbing features of the september 11 attacks is that it is difficult to see its purpose beyond the authors resentment of the west and its customs', 'but the key features of the west democracy and the rule of law have received much worse beatings at the hands of their supporters than their attackers', 'above all it takes two things to regain confidence in freedom within the democracies affected by the legacy of september 11th', 'we must make sure that the relevant legislation to deal with the challenges of terrorism is strictly temporary', 'some of the current limitations on habeas corpus and civil liberties have sunset terms that limit their validity parliaments need to reexamine all these rules regularly', 'second and more important our leaders must try to calm the publics anxiety rather than take advantage of it', 'the terrorists we are currently in the war with cant win because their dark vision will never gain popular legitimacy', 'all the more reason for the democrats to stand up to defend our values first of all acting in accordance with them', 'the 9th of november in perspective', 'a decade ago 19 terrorists took control of four planes headed two toward the twin towers of the world trade center collided a third against the pentagon and a quarter fell on a field in pennsylvania after passengers resisted and prevented the terrorists from carrying out their evil mission within hours more than 3000 innocent people mostly americans but also people from another 115 countries were suddenly and violently killed', 'september 11 2001 was a terrible tragedy in every respect but it was no historical turning point', 'he didnt announce a new era of international relations in which terrorists would prevail on a global agenda nor in which spectacular terrorist attacks would become commonplace', 'on the contrary a 911 hasnt been repeated', 'in spite of the attention paid to the global war on terrorism the most important advances of the last ten years have been the introduction and spread of groundbreaking information technology the globalization the wars in iraq and afghanistan and political unrest in the middle east', 'as for the future its much more likely to be determined by the need of the united states to bring its economy into order chinas history within and beyond its borders and the ability of the worlds governments to cooperate in the reestablishment of economic growth curb the proliferation of nuclear weapons and meet energy and environmental challenges', 'it is and would be a mistake to make the fight against terrorism the centerpiece of what responsible governments around the world are doing', 'terrorists remain marginal elements with limited appeal at best', 'you can destroy but you cant create', 'it is worth pointing out that those who took to the streets of cairo and damascus calling for change didnt shout al qaeda slogans or support their remarks', 'furthermore steps have been taken to successfully back off terrorists', 'intelligence resources have been shifted', 'borders have become safer and societies have become more resilient', 'international cooperation has increased noticeably in part because governments that dont agree on many other issues can understand the need for cooperation in this area', 'the military has played an important part', 'al qaeda lost its base in afghanistan when the taliban government that had provided it with shelter was expelled from power', 'at last osama bin laden was found and eliminated by the us special forces on the outskirts of islamabad', 'unmanned and remotely driven planes have proven effective in the disposal of a large number of terrorists including many of the most important leaders', 'weak governments can be made stronger governments that tolerate or support terrorism must be held accountable', 'however we must not confuse progress with victory', 'it is not possible to eliminate terrorists and terrorism any more than we can rid the world of diseases', 'there will always be those who resort to force against innocent men women and children in the search for political goals', 'terrorists are actually making progress in some areas', 'pakistan remains a haven for al qaeda and some of the most dangerous terrorists in the world', 'a mixture of government weakness and ideology in countries like yemen libya somalia and nigeria is giving rich territory so terrorists can organize train and mount operations very similar to what they did in afghanistan a decade ago', 'new groups are constantly rising from the ruins of the ancients', 'there is also a growing danger of domestic terrorism', 'weve seen it in britain and america', 'the internet one of the great inventions of the modern western world has proven to be a weapon that can be used to elicit and train those who wish to cause harm to it', 'the question raised in october 2003 by the then us secretary of defense donald rumsfeld is no less relevant today are we catching removing or dissuade more terrorists every day than those who recruit train and expose radical clerics to us in madrasas', 'on equal terms its likely to be so', 'but even the smallest terrorist successes are expensive in terms of lives and money and it makes open societies less expensive', 'what should be done', 'unfortunately there is no onesizefitsall or magic recipe', 'the establishment of a palestinian state will not be enough for terrorists seeking the elimination of the jewish state just as arriving at an agreement on kashmir will not be satisfactory for pakistanbased terrorists who have more ambitious plans for india', 'it is desirable to reduce unemployment of course but many terrorists do not come from poverty', 'helping society in the middle east and other parts of the world to become more democratic could reduce alienation from radicalism but this is easier said than done', 'of course we want to continue looking for ways to make ourselves less vulnerable and terrorists still more', 'but what could be more important particularly in arab and islamic communities than putting an end to the acceptation of terrorism', 'the nigerian father who warned the us embassy in lake that he was afraid of what his son might do before the same young man tried to detonate a bomb aboard a flight bound for detroit on christmas day in 2009 is an example of just this', 'only when more parents teachers and community leaders behave in the same way will the recruiting of terrorists be exhausted and the police authorities will receive full cooperation from the populations they protect', 'to lose its power terrorism must lose its legitimacy among those who have traditionally supported or tolerated it', 'transatlantic trade for all', 'washington dc negotiations for a transatlantic trade and investment partnership between the european union and the united states are being very well received', 'the british prime minister david cameron has said that this partnership is a prize thats given once in a generation referring to the potential earnings of £80 billion us125500 million for both the eu and the usa and £85 billion for the rest of the world', 'for a world tired of waiting for the end of the world trade organizations neverending round of doha negotiations even a bilateral trade effort may seem like a blessing especially as a financial times editorial recently pointed out when bilateral covers half of the worlds economy', 'but there is a serious downside the agreement could affect developing country exports unless the eu and the usa made a concerted effort to protect the interests of those players', 'the characteristic of the proposed compact that breeds greater enthusiasm its focus on regulatory barriers as mandatory product standards is actually the one that should arouse the greatest concern', 'because of the low eu and us duties which are less than 5 on average greater preferred cuts will not seriously harm the outsiders', 'but when it comes to standards such as those that govern safety health and the environment the market access requirements are abrupt and binaries either someone meets the established standards or doesnt sell', 'as a result the choices that third country companies have will depend on how ttip standards are set either by harmonising adopting a common standard or by mutual recognition accepting products that meet the standards set by both parties', 'the first option would allow producers everywhere to take advantage of economies of scale', 'but in some cases the uniformized standards might be more strict than the original standards of some countries', 'while the new standards would apply to suppliers in all exporting countries compliance costs usually vary meaning that those who are less equipped to meet higher standards might be affected', 'at the end of the 1990s when the eu decided to harmonize the standards for aflatoxins a group of toxic compounds produced by certain mildews eight member states including italy the netherlands and spain substantially raised their national standards which probably caused african exports of cereals dried fruit and dried fruit to fall to europe by 670 million dollars', 'with mutual recognition the eu and the us would accept both the standards or the conformity analysis procedures which would allow companies to stick to the less strict requirements in each area', 'if policy were extended to third country companies this would have a strong liberalizing impact', 'for example television producers in malaysia could choose to meet say more relaxed security standards in the united states and then sell the same product in both markets thereby reaping the benefits of scale economies while lowering compliance costs', 'on the contrary if ttip were to exclude thirdcountry companies from the policy of mutual recognition its competition with european and american companies would be substantially reduced', 'in fact our research shows that when mutual recognition agreements include rules of origin intraregional trade increases at the expense of trade with other countries and developing countries suffer the most', 'in fact overly strict rules of origin proved to be problematic for some of the previous eu recognition agreements such as those that govern professional service standards', 'while a brazilian orange that is allowed to be sold in portugal can be sold all over the eu a brazilian engineer or accountant hired in portugal must meet different hiring requirements in order to be able to work elsewhere in the eu this affects muchneeded job mobility since it makes noneuropean workers suffer from expensive and inefficient red tape', 'furthermore when it comes to tariffs and standards the rules of the world trade organization are not fair', 'while they protect countries that are not covered by bilateral or regional customs agreements thereby ensuring that integrated markets do not receive any additional advantages there are few safeguards to protect third countries from the impact of agreements on mandatory standards', 'even in the absence of international rules the eu and the us could take two steps to make sure that ttip has no adverse consequences for developing countries', 'first they could allow all countries to reap the benefits of a mutual recognition agreement by agreeing not to impose restrictive rules of origin', 'second where they do consider harmonising they could favor the original less strict standards unless there is credible evidence that this would not support the relevant regulatory objective', 'this is similar to a world trade organization test of nonfulfilment of established international standards', 'if the eu and the usa put these two compromises into practice the rest of the world would follow the ttip negotiations with hope rather than concern', 'a deal harmful to the future of the united states', 'on august 2 president barack obama barely got the passage of a budget law for the us which combined an increase in the legal ceiling on public debt with a reduction in federal spending avoiding the risk of falling into the first cut in payments in americas 224year history', 'but the agreement reached has three major flaws', 'two of them make up for each other but the third is a threat to what the united states will need most in the coming years economic growth', 'the first flaw is that spending cuts are inconvenient as they come at a time when the us economy is weak so theres a risk of provoking a new recession', 'the second flaw of the approved measure is that the planned reduction is not enough', 'but even though the approved plan will be insufficient to solve the problem of the growing and chronic budget deficit in the united states at least it is likely that it wont cause much damage to the economy in the short run', 'the third and most harmful flaw however is that the cutbacks will apply in the wrong places', 'since democratic congressmen have an almost religious commitment to keeping the countrys main social benefits programs for senior citizens unabated social security and medicare the project doesnt touch either of them', 'but as the 78 million americans in the baby boom generation persons born between 1946 and 1964 withdraw and begin to receive benefits the cost of these programs will skyrocket this will be the greatest increase in government spending and the expected deficit over the coming years', 'and since republican congressmen are equally allergic to any tax hikes no matter when or under what circumstances the reduction of the bills deficit will have to be achieved without raising taxes even for richer americans', 'all of the spending cuts will be made in the discretionary part of the federal budget this leaves out social security medicare the medicaid program for the poorest and public debt interests', 'what remains to be cut is just onethird of the total federal spending and much of that portion is from the defense budget which republicans will seek to protect in the future', 'so the scheme created by the august 2 agreement concentrates the reduction of the deficit on the portion of the federal budget that is discretionary not for defense which is just 10 of the total', 'this is a very small source of funds for the level of savings that the country will need in the coming years', 'even worse nonmilitary deliberate spending includes programs essential to economic growth which in turn is essential to the prosperity and international position of the united states in the future', 'first the countrys best way to reduce its budget deficit is to grow', 'the higher the growth rate the higher the revenues the government will be able to raise without increasing taxes and the higher the revenues will reduce the deficit', 'furthermore economic growth is necessary to keep the promise of great importance to each of the americans that each generation will have the chance to be more successful than the previous generation something that is known in colloquial language as the american dream', 'and for those who arent americans its equally important that only sound economic growth can guarantee that the us will continue its expanding role in the world which serves as a supporter of the global economy and a driver of stability in europe east asia and the middle east', 'as thomas l friedman and i explained in our next book that use to be wed how america fell behind in the world it invented and how we can come back was what the united states was how it was left behind in the world how it invented and how it could recover one factor in americas economic success was the continued cooperation between the private and public sector dating back to the time of the founding of the country which is now in danger because of the kind of cutbacks stipulated in the august 2 agreement', 'that collaboration consists of five elements extensive educational opportunities that allow for the production of a highly skilled labor force investment in tradesupporting infrastructures such as roads power plants and harbors funding of research and development activities that extend the borders of knowledge in order to create new products an immigration policy that attracts and holds talented people born outside the united states and strong enough business regulation to prevent disasters such as the near collapse of the financial system in 2008 but not so strict that it stifles innovation and the willingness to take risks which are necessary for growth', 'the first three elements of the american formula for growth cost money and that money which is part of the nondefense discretionary spending provided for in the federal budget is now in the focus of the agreement to raise the debt ceiling', 'cutting spending on these programs will slow americas economic growth in the long run with negative consequences that will be felt both within the country and abroad', 'trying to reduce the deficit by saving in education infrastructure and research and development activities is like wanting to lose weight by cutting three fingers one keeps most of the weight but the life prospects are much worse', 'in order to raise the debt ceiling it was necessary to reduce the deficit but the way adopted by the law of august 2nd is a mistake', 'unless in order to achieve this inevitable reduction it is more likely to limit benefit programs and increase revenues than it is to cut programs that are essential to economic growth the result will be a poorer and weaker country as well as a more uncertain and perhaps more stable world', 'a balanced look at the sinoamerican disequilibria', 'before july most economists agreed that global imbalances were the most important threat to overall growth', 'it was said that the growing relationship between net foreign debt and the gdp the result of chronic current account deficits would put an abrupt brake on capital revenues in turn undermining the dollar raising interest rates and plunge the american economy into a crisis', 'but this scenario never materialized', 'on the other hand the crisis arose from the collapse of americas highrisk mortgages which quickly pulled the global economy into its deepest recession since the 1930s', 'most economists didnt anticipate the economic dynamic that actually led to the crisis because they didnt pay enough attention to the rapid increase in total american debt', 'instead they concentrated entirely on americas foreign debt ignoring house debt mortgage and consumption debt public debt business debt and financial debt', 'in particular they should have paid more attention to the sustainability of americas mortgage and consumption debt', 'in 2007 the relationship between mortgage and consumption debt and gdp was above 90 percent compared to 24 percent of foreign net debt', 'of course the various components of debt differ considerably in nature and sources of finance and consequently in their sustainability', 'but all the parts of a countrys total debt and how its funded are interconnected', 'this means two things', 'first funds from different sources of finance are somewhat interchangeable the shortage of funds for one part of the total debt can be replaced by surplus funds originally intended to finance other components', 'second the problems in a single part of the total debt will have an impact on all the other components', 'after the highrisk mortgage crisis broke out the mortgage and consumption debt was partially settled by the homes either with savings or by default', 'the fall in americas total debt and the narrowing of the funding divide between total debt and domestic funds led to a significant increase in the us current account deficit in 20082009 refuting the argument by the chairman of the us federal reserve board ben bernanke that the deficit was caused by a global excess of savings', 'in fact the us current account position grew stronger in spite of the dollars appreciation of the demand for shelter', 'unfortunately as a result of private sector deleverage and an increase in household savings the us economy driven by debt and consumption fell into recession', 'to make up for the negative impact of private sector deleverage on growth the us government maintained expansing fiscal and monetary policies', 'at a time when the debt of the homes was one thread in the wake of feverish government intervention the tax position deteriorated drastically and the current account balance got worse again', 'public debt sustainability replaced private debt sustainability as the greatest threat to financial stability and the focus of the debate on the us current account shifted from foreign debt sustainability to the impact of narrowing the external deficit on growth and jobs', 'the dilemma facing americas policymakers is how to spur growth while at the same time reduce the level of total debt', 'the most important way to accomplish both goals is to increase exports by improving american competition', 'but where will the greatest competition arise', 'dvaluation of the dollar could improve american competition in the short run but its not a solution', 'since the rapid tax decline today makes investors worried about the capital loss on us government bills the dvaluation would make foreigners more doubtful about how to finance the us budget deficit', 'if foreign finance doesnt arrive soon the us governments return on debt will increase and the us economy will fall into recession again', 'in the long run americas growth pattern must undergo a structural shift from debt and consumption dependence to one based on the ability of americans to boast about creativity and innovation', 'only then will the us improve its competition enough to allow the government to reduce both public and private debt to a sustained level while maintaining a respectable growth rate', 'however neither improved competition nor a reduction in total debt can be achieved overnight', 'in the short run americas current account deficit will continue beyond which country has any bilateral surplus', 'chinas continued reinvestment of its current account surplus into united states government bills is then of the utmost importance to americas growth and financial stability', 'since the united states extremely benefits from chinas purchase of us government bills its difficult to understand why the us government and congress are complaining so much about the bilateral current account deficit', 'it is also difficult to understand why china is so reluctant to reduce its bilateral surplus as opposed to the meager returns on its massive title holding by the us government and a sustained risk of large future capital losses', 'the good news is that after president hu jintaos recent visit to washington both the united states and china took positive steps to settle their differences on the bilateral current account balance', 'that augur well for a more rational and constructive sinoamerican dialogue on global imbalances which would certainly benefit the global economy', 'the voice of israel is abba eban', 'for almost two generations abba eban was the voice of israel its message to the mightiest nations and at the same time to the jewish people around the world', 'since his first appearance at the side of dr chaim weizmann in the late 1940s during the struggle for the sovereignty and statehood of israel few people were able to articulate the zionist cause and then the israeli one with comparable eloquence and conviction', 'with her churchillian prosa and her almost shakespearean cadences her mellifluous sentences and her loud voice carried for decades a message of hope to a people who could have lost all faith and trust in humanity after the horrors of world war ii', 'as ambassador to the united states and the united nations and then as foreign minister he represented an israel with which the liberal imagination of the world could be identified', 'bigger and more powerful nations envied such a powerful speaker and his speeches became models for statesmen and diplomats from distant lands', 'his books which took time to write in spite of the hectic demands of diplomacy were a unique combination of great crystal clearness and erudition', 'his academic background and rhetorical gifts complimented each other in an unusual way', 'on rare occasions a small country has been represented by a statesman of such an international standing only tom masaryk and jan smuts could compare themselves with him', 'he was a true patriot in the old sense of the word proud of his people but never an ethnocentrist a man of the world but deeply grounded in the jewish cultural heritage focused on the adversities and hardships of the jewish people but never losing sight of the universal horizon of mankind', 'in short he was a modernday man in the best sense of the word', 'it was said that prime minister levi eshkol spoke seven languages all of them in yiddish', 'eban could be said to speak ten all with an accent from oxford or cambridge', 'what was attractive in the outside world however was not always the right thing in the harsh atmosphere of israels politics', 'perhaps eban was too polite too academic and too gentlemanly to get to the top of the pole according to the sentence by dei', 'together with golda meir and moshe dayan he had to leave the government in 1974 after the yom kippur war', 'he could hardly be blamed for the arrogance caused by the avalanche of 1973 and yet he also pulled it along', 'he never managed to find his way back and when he faced the new politics of primary election and populism he was discouraged by his powerlessness in this new style', 'in the international arena ebans pen was his sword and his word was his spear', 'he was less skillful in the internal political struggle in israel', 'he could be a fierce warrior but it would be fair to say that he could have fought more bravely for his moderate views in the post1967 government in which he served', 'it is impossible to tell if he had succeeded given his lack of an independent political basis but his international reputation and stature could have given him the chance if he had wanted to launch the challenge', 'he never did', 'ebans silence in recent years was not just a result of his disenchantment with israels politics or his deteriorating health', 'at a time when the political debate in israel is divided between pseudoreligious and antizionist fanatics who present themselves as postmodernists ebans moral accuracy with all its politeness may sound banal', 'but building a nation requires moral vigor and eban gave it abundantly to his people and to the world', 'without talking to eban in recent years im sure hed be extremely unsatisfied with what happened after the failure of campo david and taba in 200001 and the current course of the israeli policy would give him a bad feeling', 'in all likelihood however he would have been much more disappointed with the inability of the palestinians to come to terms with the idea of a jewish state', 'formed arabist immersed in arab and muslim culture he always hoped that the glorious arab past would be rejuvenated that an arab and muslim culture of tolerantness would succeed over fanaticism and extremism', 'this was the basis for their hope for a jewisharabic settlement', 'the fact that this arab rebirth to use the sentence of the great palestinian academic george antonius was not given may have been the greatest disappointment for eban', 'in spite of the highkiln image that he was projecting eban was an extremely vulnerable person what some occasionally sensed as vanity traits may have been due to his humble origin', 'although he seemed to speak english about royal affairs eban was not born in any palace he came from the most modest hints of english judaism', 'he was in the true sense of the word a man who succeeded by his own means whose pride ambition energy and faith in his destiny brought him to the summit', 'he was an aristocrat of the spirit', 'in that abba eban was a true example of the people he so proudly represented', 'abdullah at risk', 'the plan revealed to an american journalist during a private dinner with the prince is focused on the whole normalization of relations between israel and all arab countries in exchange for the israeli withdrawal from all of the palestinian territories he occupied in 1967 the proposal might be reinforced when abdullah meets with president bush in texas in the spring but his early survival depends first on how he is received at the next arab summit in beirut', 'the suspicions surrounding abdullahs move which rule out her being dead before shes born are based on the suspicion that she was meant to appease the us critics of saudi arabia and to avoid focusing on the countrys internal tension since september 11th saudi arabia has been under intense pressure to explain its links with the alqaeda terrorist network of osama bin laden because fifteen of the nineteen kidnappers were in the country were in the country in fact it is said that most of the us prisoners in cubas guantánamo bay are saudi citizens and the main sources of alqaeda funding are often considered to be saudis', 'at the same time saudi public opinion has become hotter especially because of the apparent apathy of their leaders to the suffering of the palestinian people particularly when compared to the lethal propaganda of osama bin laden since the terrorist attacks of september 11th the saudi leaders have felt pressure to accommodate the publics refusal to illtreat the palestinians but they worry that doing so might compromise their fragile relations with the united states even more', 'a proposal for total normalization with israel coming from an islamic regime that based its legitimacy on the austere muslim doctrines of the wahabis seemed both peculiar and progressive however the image of stable benevolent and mystical community harmony that had long been cultivated by saudi arabia had given in to the endless and sharp look of the american press', 'the apparently hostile attention of the united states gave rise to the speculation that prince abdullahs proposal actually indicates a counteroffensive of public relations that was devised at the us embassy in washington to cover disagreements with the us in effect the following deafening silence of other saudi leaders over the proposal seems to confirm that it is a public relations move by which they dont have to risk anything of their own internal political capital', 'though in the west there is general talk of abdullah as the ruler of saudi arabia the six brothers of the debilitated king fahd really represent the real power in the kingdom neither the king nor those other brothers known as the sudairis as a whole have said anything for or against', 'apparently the sudairis have left their halfbrother alone in the wind abdullahs proposal could debilitate his internal position especially with regard to the countrys powerful islamic groups', 'although prince abdullah has his own group of loyal supporters including the national guard he faces opposition from important figures in the religious class', 'the idea of normalizing relations with israel has resulted in fierce hatred among some islamic leaders both in mosques and online', 'as a result abdullahs initial proposal has gone so thin that for the meeting of arab foreign affairs ministers held in cairo on march 8th the phrase complete normalization had been reduced to the amorfast total peace whose meaning no one knows', 'does that mean an israeli flag with the star of david flying in riad or that abdullah will have to visit jerusalem to be received with a kiss from ariel sharon no one knows but the very fact that those questions are coming up in saudi arabia means a serious risk to abdullah', 'there are also objections to the princes plan not to mention the right of the palestinian exiles to return to their homes in the west bank and gaza as well as in israel itself and that the arab people have to adjust their diplomatic efforts to the likes of the american media for the common saudis the move seems like a simple way to sell itself or a prelude to a new humiliation', 'the reaction in the middle east reflects the ageold rivalries for leadership as well as fears about american and israeli intentions egypts leaders regard the proposal as a simple conversation something that isnt even distantly as serious as a diplomatic effort in writing', 'libya offered its own proposal supposed to be more allround and allinclusive hizbollahs leader mohammed fadlallah described the proposal as one of arab subservience while syria demanded a guarantee of its interests in the golan heights', 'the arab league leaders approved the proposal', 'prince abdullahs proposal will be made official in a speech at the arab league summit in beirut on 2728 march', 'the way in which it is received will have to determine not only the status of the negotiations between the israelis and the palestinians for a long time but also the internal peace of saudi arabia', 'a berlin consensus', 'a recent trip to berlin brought back memories of a previous visit in the summer of 1967 when i was a poor student who marveled at the wall that would divide and devastated an entire society for another two decades', 'berlin today is a vibrant and rejuvenated city which has been rebuilt thanks to the hard work and the will of the german people to unify the country for the same reason it was a suitable place to hold the conference of the institute for new economic thought to which i had traveled as a participants', 'the theme of the conference was lost paradigm bringing together more than 300 economists political scientists system analysts and ecologists to rethink economic and political theory in the face of the challenges and uncertainty posed by growing inequality rising unemployment global financial clutter and climate change', 'almost everyone agreed that the old paradigm of the neoclassical economy no longer served but there was no agreement on what could replace it', 'nobel laureate amartya sen attributed the european crisis to four failures political economic social and intellectual', 'the global financial crisis which began in 2007 as a crisis of highrisk mortgage lending in the us and grew into a crisis of european sovereign debt and banks has raised questions that we cant answer due to overspecialization and fragmentation of knowledge', 'and yet it cannot be denied that the world has become too complex for a simple and general theory to explain the intricate economic technological population and environmental changes', 'in particular the rise of emerging markets has challenged traditional western deductive and inductive logic', 'deductive inference allows us to predict the effects if we know the principles the rule and the cause', 'according to inductive thinking if we know the cause and the effects we can infer the principles', 'on the contrary eastern thought has been abstract moving from pragmatism to guessing the next steps', 'abductive inference is pragmatic and focused only on results trying to guess the rule and identify the cause', 'like history the theory of social science is written by the conquerors and shaped by the context and challenges of their time', 'free market thinking evolved from anglosaxon theorists many of them scottish who emigrated and colonized territories leading lucky people to assume that there are no limits to consumption', 'european thinking on the continent in response to urban development and the need for social order stressed the institutional analysis of the political economy', 'therefore the rise of the neoclassical economy in the 19th century was heavily influenced by newtonian and cartesian physics it went from quality analysis to human behavior taking for granted rational behavior and avoiding uncertainty', 'this thought of a defeated balance as reflected in the opinion that markets always correct themselves led to a paralysis of policies to the great depression when john maynard keynes argument for government intervention in dealing with unemployment and production divides gained strength', 'in the 1970s the neoclassical school of general balance absorbed the keynesian economy through realsector models that assumed that financing is a wake thereby blinding itself to the destabilizing effects of financial markets', 'to a large extent economists like hyman minsky who tried to correct this were ignored while milton friedman and others led the professions push toward free markets and the governments slightest intervention', 'but then technology demography and globalization posed new and dramatic challenges that the neoclassical approach couldnt predict', 'even though the advanced countries of the world overused themselves by leveraged financial products about four thousand out of the seven billion inhabitants of the planet began to enter the middle class putting enormous pressure on world resources and raising the problem of environmental sustainability', 'a new way of thinking is needed to respond to these massive and systematized changes as well as the integration of giants like china and india into the modern world', 'a change of mind that is necessary not only in the west but also in the east', 'in 1987 historian ray huang explained the case of china', 'as the world enters the modern era most countries under domestic and external pressure must be rebuilt by changing the mode of government based on land experience to a new set of rules based on trade this is easier said than done', 'the process of renovation could affect the upper and lower layers and it is inevitable that there is a need to refurbish the institutional links between them', 'complete destruction is often order and it may take decades to bring the matter to an end', 'through this macrohistorical framework we can see japanese deflation european debt and even arab spring as stages of systemic changes within ounce160 complex structures that intersect each other in a new global multipolar system', 'we are seeing a process of overall convergence reducing income wealth and knowledge divides among countries and local differences expanding income differences wealth and knowledge within countries at the same time', 'adaptive systems struggle with order and creativity as they develop', 'as philosopher bertrand russell put it prophetically security and justice require centralized government control that must extend to the building of a world government in order to be effective', 'progress on the contrary requires the greatest personal effort that is compatible with social order', 'a new wave of what economist joseph schumpeter called creative destruction is underway even when central banks struggle to keep their markets stable flooding their markets with cash credit is being reduced to businesses and homes', 'we live in an era of simultaneous fear of inflation and deflation of unprecedented prosperity amid growing inequity and of advances in technology and resource depletion', 'in the meantime todays political systems promise good jobs sound government a sustained environment and sacrificeless social harmony a haven of polyzones that take care of their own interests and can only be sustained at the cost of sacrificing the natural environment and the welfare of future generations', 'we cant always put off the pain of finetuning with the impression of money', 'sustainability can be achieved only when those who have it are willing to sacrifice themselves for those who are deprived', 'the washington consensus of free market reforms for developing countries came to an end more than two decades ago', 'the berlin inet conference showed the need for a new one a consensus compatible with sacrifice for unity', 'a better and more secure europe', 'for many including me the extension of nato to include the baltic states of estonia latvia and lithuania which were former soviet republics among others is an impossible dream that has come true', 'when the idea came up for the first time 10 years ago few people took the issue of enlargement seriously towards these states', 'until recently russias firm opposition to the idea was a serious obstacle as it sharpened the impression that russia regarded its neighboring republics as an area of special interest and influence', 'the nato enlargement has made it quite clear that no country in the new europe can be regarded as part of another countrys zone', 'this assures the three small countries that the nightmare of the occupation by the larger neighbors the hitler reich and the soviet union of stalin suffered by them for half a century will not be repeated', 'by putting a limit on any revanchist tendency in russia over the baltic republics europe is made a safer place and russia is helped in its efforts to define itself as a national state and not an empire', 'enlargement will also create a better europe because it increases the territory in which countries are committed to natos political values including individual and minority rights', 'fortunately russia now seems to understand the value of this political aspect of natos enlargement', 'natos enlargement is not an expansion threatening russia or other countries that are trying to put democratic political reforms into practice', 'on the contrary the spread erases the concerns whether real or imaginary about the situation of the large russianspeaking population living today outside russia but within the borders of the former soviet union', 'the civil rights of russian minorities in the baltic states and elsewhere are now guaranteed by law thanks not to a small extent to natos demands', 'these nato civil rights efforts reflect the evergreater coordination with which russia europe and the united states deal with their mischievousnesses', 'in fact nato enlargement takes place only a few days after russia and the eu reached an agreement on the difficult issue of access to the russian enclave of kaliningrad', 'this small part of russia with a million inhabitants and on the coast of the baltic sea is inserted between poland and lithuania two future members of the eu', 'this could have given rise to a complicated situation in which the russians would have had to meet demanding visa requirements when traveling between kaliningrad and the rest of russia', 'president putin and the eu reached an agreement that makes access much easier without affecting the status of both lithuania and poland within the eu regime', 'this in turn once again created the kind of situation in which everyone gains so important for future relations between the eu and russia', 'when the eus enlargement into central and eastern europe is finally decided by the council of europe in copenhagen next month the conclusion will be clear europe has become a much better and safer place to live thanks to decisions made by nato and the eu during the crucial autumn of 2002', 'but this is no reason for complacency as the really hard work is just beginning dealing with all the internal political and practical problems that will arise with the enlargements as well as dealing with countries that are waiting to be members particularly russia', 'relations with russia are vital for europe to continue to improve the quality of life of its citizens and to address security concerns', 'the common threat of international terrorism must be addressed as a whole', 'we must convince each other that the fight against this common enemy must be carried out with a careful eye to balance security needs with those of human rights and minorities', 'kaliningrad can be a test of fire for these relationships', 'the first obstacle was overcome by the agreement on access to the enclave', 'the next is to support kaliningrads struggle against sickness and crime as well as the reinforcement of its economic and social structure', 'this requires the eus generousness and moscows flexibleness', 'in a larger context this could lead to the entrenchment of the socalled eu northern dimension where the goal is a free trade area that includes all countries around the baltic sea', 'such a project can be accomplished if political will exists and it can be imposed', 'only a few years ago the eu and the nato enlargement were seen as hopeless dreams', 'but political will and determination have made dreams a reality today', 'today is the time to set new and ambitious goals for europe', 'a better way to reduce nuclear risks', 'in 1977 when i worked in president jimmy carters state department i was sent to india to dissuade the leaders of that country from their intention to make a nuclear bomb', 'my hosts answered that they needed to do that in order not to be left behind by china', 'i said that pakistan would necessarily follow his example and the world would become less safe', 'india promised not to export its weapons technology', 'as far as we know their leaders have kept their promise but the discovery of the nuclear weapons smuggling network organized by aq jan the father of the bomb in pakistan confirms the danger that i predicted then', 'some people call the khans network an operation to spread an islamic bomb but since north korea was on the receiving list along with libya and iran it would be better to call it a corrupt bomb', 'as the events in pakistan exemplify the spread of nuclear technology does not extend the stability of mutual deterrence', 'rather it increases the possibility of corrupt leaks that can give terrorist groups access to nuclear weapons', 'everyone is less safe with that', 'any pathological group of extremists could destroy new delhi tokyo paris or any city they chose', 'now the worlds attention is focused on iran one of the receiving countries for pakistans technology as the most apparently willing country to build its own nuclear weapons tank', 'according to the international atomic energy agency iaea iran began to upgrade uranium at a pilot centrifuge facility last august and is building larger underground enrichment plants', 'iran claims that its programs are for the peaceful generation of nuclear power but the inspectors have already found traces of highlyenriched uranium for weapons purposes', 'last october the director of the international atomic energy agency mohamed el baradei announced that iran had accepted more strict inspection procedures', 'in addition after visits by the foreign ministers of france britain and germany iran announced a temporary suspension of its enrichment program', 'he is now insinuating that he can resume his wealth and recent press reports on imports from pakistan suggest that iran did not teach everything to the iaea', 'as a party to the nonproliferation treaty iran claims that it has the right to develop uranium for peaceful purposes', 'thats true because the treaty was born with a pond', 'even if a country accepts largescale inspections by the iaea it can legally build up enriched uranium or recessed plutonium under a peaceful energy program and then suddenly declare that circumstances have changed and withdrawn from the treaty with the ability to produce nuclear weapons in the short run', 'if it were to do so not only would it increase the dangers in an unsettled region but it would probably start a process of dismantlement of the nonproliferation regime on a global scale', 'iran may ask what other rights it has to demand that it renounce nuclear weapons', 'the answer is that you promised to do that when you signed the npt and the consequences that it would imposed on others', 'for those reasons president bush declared an iranian nuclear weapon unacceptable', 'however the united statess onesided options are limited', 'not only is the us army very busy in iraq but also the way that that country intervened in iraq which turned out to have fewer nuclear capabilities than in iran has damaged american credit making it difficult to enlist allies to hold back irans nuclear ambitions', 'fortunately there is a multilateral option and there is already a precedent', 'in the mid1970s many countries that were parties to the npt set out to import and develop enrichment and reprocessing facilities', 'realizing the threat it posed to the nonproliferation regime countries as many as the soviet union france germany and japan formed a nuclear supplier group that limited the export of enrichment and reprocessing facilities', 'this partly filled the loophole of the treaty without changing it', 'those countries must now group together to offer iran and others a deal', 'those countries that wish to develop nuclear power but not to manufacture nuclear bombs should receive international guarantees of the supply of fuel and the disposal of off fuel', 'for example russia which is helping iran build a nuclear power plant in bushehr must offer that country a guarantee of lowenriched uranium fuel and reprocessing of the offreactor fuel by sending it back to russia if iran agrees to give up its fortification and reprocessing', 'such treatment could then be confirmed by the united nations security council', 'the council would declare that the further proliferation of nuclear weapons is a threat to peace and that any country following that direction will be subject to punishment', 'that resolution would also include guarantee to iran of access to nondangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle', 'the proposal could be made more attractive by offering to relax the current sanctions and provide a security guarantee if iran does not nuclearize', 'european foreign affairs ministers have already expressed their concerns about the nuclear program of iran', 'russia has indicated that it is willing to provide such fuel services', 'it is time for the security council to try to internationalize the most dangerous parts of the nuclear fuel cycle', 'it is not too late to take advantage of the lessons learned from aq jans devious adventures', 'a great opportunity for small farmers', 'the g8s effort to earmark 20 billion dollars for smallholder farms launched at that groups recent meeting in laquila italy is a potential landmark in the fight against hunger and extreme poverty', 'with a serious management of the new funds food production in africa will skyrocket', 'in fact the new effort combined with others in the areas of health education and infrastructure could be the greatest step so far towards the achievement of the millennium development goals the internationally agreed effort to halve extreme poverty disease and hunger by 2015', 'during the period from 2002 to 2006 i headed the united nations millennium project which is aimed at meeting the development goals of the united nations for the then secretary general of the united nations kofi annan', 'one of the key stones of the project was the smallholder farmers that is families of farmers in africa latin america and asia farms of about one ha or less', 'they are some of the worlds poorest homes and also which is ironic some of the most hungry even though they are food producers', 'they suffer from hunger because they lack the ability to buy highyielding seeds fertilizers watering equipment and other instruments needed to increase their productivity', 'as a result their production is scarce and insufficient for their living', 'poverty causes low agricultural output and poverty increases', 'its a vicious circle traditionally called a poverty trap', 'the un millennium hunger project task force led by two worldleader scientists m s swaminathan and pedro sánchez discussed ways of overcoming that vicious circle the hunger task force concluded that if aid was granted to farmers with small farms in the form of agricultural inputs africa could substantially increase its food production', 'the millennium project recommended a large increase in global funding for that purpose on the basis of that work and related scientific conclusions annan launched a call in 2004 for an african green revolution based on an expanded partnership between africa and donor countries', 'many of us particularly the current un secretary general ban kimoon have worked hard to make it possible and ban has repeatedly stressed the special emergency caused by the world food financial and energy crisis of the past two years', 'the announcement of the g8 reflects those years of effort and of course the impulses given by the president of the united states barack obama the spanish prime minister josé luis rodríguez zapatero the australian prime minister kevin rudd the president of the world bank robert zoellick the european commissioner louis michel the representative of the european parliament thijs berman and others', 'now the key is to making that effort work', 'the lessons of history are clear', 'giving seeds and fertilizers to smallholder farmers at largely subsidized prices or even free in some cases will make a longterm difference', 'not only will the shortterm food harvests increase but also farmers homes will use their higher income and better health to accumulated all kinds of goods cash stocks land nutrients farm animals and their childrens health and education', 'this increase in assets will in turn allow local credit markets such as microfinance to begin to function', 'farmers will be able to buy supplies either with their own money or by loan on account of their creditworthiness', 'a consensus has now been reached on the need to help small farms but obstacles remain', 'perhaps the greatest risk is that the aid bureaucracies are scolding to try to get a good cut of 20 billion leaving much of it at meetings expert consults overheads reports and more meetings', 'donor associations can become an expensive end in themselves leading to a mere delay in the application of real measures', 'if donor governments really want to get results they must stop putting money in the hands of thirty or more different bureaucracies and put it together in one or two places the most logical of which would be the world bank in washington and the international fund for agricultural development in rome', 'one or two of those bodies would then have an account of several billion dollars', 'governments in hungry areas in particular africa would then present national action plans that would provide details of how they would use donor funds to provide highyield seeds fertilizers watering agricultural tools storage silos and local advice to poor farmers', 'an independent expert group would review national plans for scientific and management coherence', 'should a plan be approved money would be spent quickly to support it', 'each of the national programs would then be supervised audited and evaluated', 'that method is simple efficient responsible and scientificly sound', 'two recent successful aid examples have used this method the global alliance for vaccinations and immunization which successfully immunizes young children and the global fund to fight aids tuberculosis and malaria which supports national plans of action to fight these deadly diseases', 'the two have saved millions of lives over the past decade and prepared the ground for a more efficient and scientificly sound method of development assistance', 'it is no wonder that many of the un bodies and aid bodies of rich countries oppose that method', 'all too often what is disputed is the territory and not the most effective way to speed up the arrival of aid to the poor', 'so obama rudd shoemaker and other groundbreaking leaders can achieve much better results by delivering on their g8 promises and insisting that aid actually yields results', 'one must break through the bureaucracies and get help where one needs it in the land farmed by the families of the worlds poorest farmers', 'a black and white problem', 'on the afternoon of july 16th two men seemed to be wanting to break into a beautiful house in an elegant neighborhood of cambridge massachusetts', 'warned by a telephone call a policeman arrived at the scene quickly', 'he saw a black man inside the house and asked him out', 'the man refused and the policeman demanded that he identify himself', 'the man still refusing to leave the house said he was a harvard teacher showed his id and warned the policeman not to mess with him', 'he said something about how in america people of color are discriminated against and demanded that the policeman who was white name and id', 'the policeman along with several colleagues arrested the teacher for causing trouble', 'today we know that the teacher forced his own house to enter with the help of his driver because the door was stuck', 'the unusual thing here isnt the harshness of the policeman', 'most people in america know that if you answer the police theyll quickly get in trouble', 'the fact that the man was black may or may not have made the policeman go for the wives faster than usual', 'that wouldnt have been unusual either', 'what made this a special case isnt the fact that henry louis skipquot gates is one of the most famous teachers in the country both for his books and for his articles and numerous tv appearances', 'hes a big man someone who pulls the strings of the academic and media worlds a friend of president barack obamas', 'thats why he warned sergeant james crowley a veteran of the cambridge police force not to mess with him', 'class and race superimpose in the united states', 'in this case it is impossible to separate them', 'being deeply aware of them and in fact a specialist in the terrible history of race relations in his country gates instinctively assumed that he was a victim of prejudice', 'by his words he seemed to be equally conscious of not receiving the respect due to a distinguished harvard professor and media star', 'as your daughter was told in an online interview quot shouldve said im sorry sir and good luck', 'i love his tv series well see if everythings all right later on', 'unfortunately sgt crowley had never heard from professor gates', 'as a local man whose brothers also work in the police sports fanatic and amateur basketball coach he just doesnt move in the same social circles as gates', 'eventually the charges were dropped and the thing wouldve stayed there if president obama tired and frustrated after weeks of fighting for his health reform law hadnt weighed the scales in favor of his quotfriendquot gates calling the policeman quot stupid quot', 'both he and gates later said that they had learned about the incident', 'gates may even be planning to make a television documentary about racial profiling', 'one thing that can be learned if we havent already done it is how close the surface of american life is to racial sensibilities in spite of the election of a black president', 'the intricacies of blacks anger white peoples guilt and the fear of both groups are so difficult that most americans prefer not to talk about racial issues', 'the field is too mined', 'one of obamas great achievements is that he made it a serious issue through the brightness of his rhetoric', 'theres still a lot of material to cut from the grotesquely disproportionate number of black men in american jails the lack of educational opportunities in poor and blackmajor areas the abhorrent health care system and the very real police brutality against blacks who dont have the privilege of owning a harvard id card', 'its probably true that many policemen even though theyve been trained to avoid racial profiling as sergeant crowley had been have to convince themselves that a black man can live in one of the best houses in cambridge or any other city in the country', 'one might argue that it is because if it isnt professor gates then who just because hes a public figure is in a position to attract national attention to a serious problem', 'if the same thing had happened to a stranger from harlem or some other poor mostly black district no one would have ever heard of the matter the fact that it happened to a teacher from cambridge makes everyone aware', 'however there is a danger that this will have an adverse effect on this necessary national debate', 'by making such a big deal out of what was a minor incident gates could be accused of trivializing much worse cases of abuse', 'as a matter of fact we dont even know for certain whether this was such an incident', 'crowley never mentioned the color of gates skin', 'there was no violence', 'only very skin nerves and hypersensitivity to subtle signs of lack of respect on the part of both the teacher and the policeman', 'outrage about a teacher you shouldnt mess with isnt the best way to discuss the pressing situation of countless poor and anonymous people who most of us find too easy to ignore', 'a girlfriend from bollywood for sarkozy', 'since french president nicolas sarkozy abandoned his countrys most coveted singles list publicly admitting his loving relationship with the supermodel who became a singer carla bruni on a romantic trip to eurodisney has started to get into trouble', 'his popularity rate has fallen to below 50 percent for the first time', 'french senior citizens dont think the public show of their loved leader is too much fun', 'overseas egyptian lawmakers felt so upset by the possibility that the french head of state would share a bed with his girlfriend that several of them expressed their disapprove in parliament', 'india is also in a dilemma about how to apply the protocol during the upcoming visit of sarkozy to the subcontinent as a guest of honor at the january 26th republic day celebrations of that country', 'should the first bride count on her own car parade as a first lady', 'in the meantime the same farright hindu groups who protest against valentines day as a decadent western party have warned that if sarkozy arrives with his girlfriend in a trailer they will go out into the streets to give him the welcome he deserves', 'that controversy has threatened to overshadow an announced summit between two of the worlds great democracies', 'with the lucrative trade deals that are at stake on the very expensive goods that drive the french economy weapons power plants and airbus planes france is keenly interested in the success of the summit in india', 'so when rumors are coming out about secret wedding ceremonies already finished or being prepared could the problems that are being forged in india in connection with the very public love life of the french president be the cause of the hurry for the couple to be legally married', 'the news appeared in the press media promoted by sarkozy', 'he admitted that he was in love with the president but refused even in the face of journalists direct questions to reveal the exact date', 'he made fun of you most likely to find out after it happened', 'the couple are rumored to have set the wedding for february 8th or 9th some people say that sarkozy has already scoffed at the media by secretly marrying at the elysée palace even though he was avoiding questions about the wedding', 'if so sarkozy has missed the romantic opportunity of her life', 'if the couple showed themselves hot in front of the cameras with luxor and petra in the background we can imagine how much hotter they could be in the most romantic place on earth the taj mahal and since everything about bollywood is raging in france a splendid indian wedding would be appropriate', 'brunis own lifetime resembles that of many stars in bollywood who have moved from model to actresses', 'a beautiful brunette who sings is perfect for a bollywoodstyle remodeling', 'the indian government will feel more than relieved to see the first bride turned wife', 'as one of indias leading newspapers has said', 'despite snakes sometimes clearly pornographic on the screen of the budding actresses of bollywood india remains a deeply conservative society', 'divorce is anathema', 'he is already divorced twice and while loved ones abound among the prime classes they dont walk in public with their powerful lovers', 'kisses and caresses in public even between husbands are the subject of taboos', 'in that regard india resembles france for which sarkozy wants to make a clean slate rather than the present one', 'most indians as many french seem to say prefer not to abandon the hypocrisy that sarkozy regrets on behalf of his predecessors read former french president françois mitterrand who had with his loved one a daughter of which the public knew nothing until his fathers funeral', 'more than anyone else he should know that much of the', 'most french could only dream of an exotic wedding in india', 'sarkozy could make that dream come true', 'if you really are as madly in love with bruni as he says and intend to marry her immediately why dont you take advantage of your next trip to india and make her an unforgettable wedding', 'he could meet his girlfriend sitting majestically on the gualdrapa of a deeply decorated elephant and she jeweled and wrapped in the best indian galas would be dazzling', 'the president', 'the cameras would roll the indians would smile and france would enjoy a bollywood show beyond what i had ever dreamed of', 'and if its too late for the wedding therell always be a banquet', 'one bomb in each of the engines', 'twentyfive years after the nuclear disaster in chernobyl the current catastrophe in the fukushima nuclear power plant in japan has clearly and once and for all revealed that the supposed benefits of the nuclear age are mere false illusions nuclear power is neither clean nor safe nor cheap', 'actually its the opposite', 'nuclear power faces unsolved serious risks the safety of power plants nuclear waste and most threateningly military proliferation', 'in addition alternatives to nuclear power and fossil fuels are well known and much more advanced and technically durable', 'accepting nuclear power is not a necessity it is a deliberate political choice', 'nuclear power and that of fossil fuels are part of the technology utopias of the 19th and 20th centuries based on the belief in the innocence of what is technologyally feasible and on the fact that at that time only a minority of people on a world scale most of them in the west benefitted from technology advances', 'on the contrary the twentyfirst century will be marked by the understanding that the global ecosystem and its resources which are essential to human survival are finite and that this carries a lasting responsibility for the preservation of what we have', 'to face this challenge will eventually involve a great amount of technology and the opportunity to redefine the meaning of modern times', 'the future of energy for nine billion people as that will be the world population in the middle of the century lies neither in fossil fuels nor in nuclear power but in renewable energy sources and the spectacular improvements in energy efficiency', 'we already know', 'why then do the more advanced countries in particular accept the risk of mega disaster when trying to create energy by means of radiofission', 'the answer lies in the end not in the civilian use of any nuclear power but above all in its military applications', 'originally energy derived from the division of uranium and plutonium atoms was used for the manufacture of the ultimate weapon the atomic bomb', 'the status of nuclear power affords protection and reputation to sovereign states', 'even today the bomb divides the world into two classes the few states that have it and the many that lack it', 'the old cold war order was based on the nuclear arms race between the two superpowers the united states and the soviet union', 'to prevent others from trying to become nuclear powers which would have increased and extended the risk of nuclear conflict the 1960s saw the formulation of the nuclear nonproliferation treaty which still governs the relations between the nuclear powers and the rest of the world with the imposition of the resignation of those who lack these weapons and the obligation of nuclear disarmament on those who have them', 'naturally the nonproliferation treaty had been violated or made fun of by states that had never signed it', 'so even today the risk remains of an increase in the number of nuclear powers especially given the hope that middle and small powers hope to increase their standing and position in regional conflicts', 'iran is the latest example of that', 'the nuclearization of those states not always stable threatened to make the conflicts of the twentyfirst century much more dangerous and would also greatly increase the risk that nuclear weapons would end up in the hands of terrorists', 'despite the nonproliferation treaty a clear distinction between civilian and military uses of nuclear power has not always worked because the treatys rules allow all signatories to develop and use all components of the civilian nuclear fuel cycle under international surveillance', 'from that point on all it takes to become a nuclear power is a small technical step and a decision by political leaders to adopt it', 'that political power not the needs of nuclear policy is what makes it so difficult to abandon nuclear power', 'as a rule the path to nuclear power always begins with socalled civil nuclear programs', 'so the supposed civil nuclear ambitions of for example iran have resulted in a large proliferation of such civil programs in neighboring states', 'honni soit qui mal and thought', 'and of course the reaction of the nuclear powers to the fukushima disaster will be observed and carefully examined by the socalled underground countries on the threshold', 'so how will the world and above all the major nuclear powers react to the fukushima disaster', 'will there really be a change of course to push the world toward nuclear disarmament and a future free of nuclear lovers', 'or will we witness attempts to take that disaster down and return to the usual situation as soon as possible', 'what happened in fukushima has put the world before a fundamental dilemma with great consequences', 'it has been japan the country of advanced technology par excellence not the soviet union that has been unable to take adequate precautions to avert a disaster in four engine blocks', 'so whatll be a future risk assessment if much less organized and developed countries begin to acquire with the active assistance of the nuclear powers civilian nuclear power capabilities', 'any decision to continue as in the past would send an unmistakable message to countries secretly at the threshold and secretly seeking nuclear weapons despite high rhetoric and verbal documents the nuclear powers lack the political will to change course', 'if they abandoned nuclear power however their momentous change of mind would be a successful contribution to global nuclear safety and consequently to the fight against nuclear proliferation', 'a move against hunger', 'the hunger crisis in the world today was never so severe and calls for urgent action', 'almost one billion people are trapped in a situation of chronic hunger perhaps 100 million more than two years ago', 'spain is taking overall leadership in the fight against hunger by inviting world leaders to madrid at the end of january to move beyond words and move to action', 'with the leadership of spain and the involvement of the united nations secretarygeneral ban ki moon several donor governments are proposing to pool their financial resources so that the worlds poorest farmers can grow more food and escape from the poverty trap', 'the benefits of donor aid can be considerable', 'farmers in africa haiti and other impoverished areas today sow their crops without the benefit of highyield seed varieties and fertilizers', 'the result is a yield of the beans for example corn which is about onethird less than what could be gained from better agricultural input', 'african farmers produce about one ton of beans per ha compared to more than four tons per ha in china where farmers use fertilizers in plenty', 'african farmers know they need fertilizers they just cant afford them', 'with the help of the donors they can', 'these farmers are then not only in a position to feed their families but they can also start creating income in the market and saving for the future', 'with a growing level of savings in a few years farmers can eventually qualify for credit or have enough cash to buy vitally important supplies on their own', 'there is a widespread consensus today about the need for increased donor funding for smallholder farmers those with two ha or less of land or poor shepherds which is especially urgent in africa', 'the un secretary general led a steering group last year that determined that african agriculture needs about 8 billion dollars a year in donor funding about four times the present total with a strong emphasis on better seeds fertilizers watering systems and extensive training', 'in addition to direct support for small farmers donors should provide increased research and development assistance needed to identify new varieties of highyield seeds especially to grow plants that can support temporary floods excess nitrogen salty soils pests of crops and other challenges to the production of food for a long time', 'helping the poor with todays technology while investing in improved future technology is the optimal division of labor', 'the amortization of this investment is wonderful with research facilities such as the international rice research institute and the international corn and wheat upgrading center that offer highyield seeds and groundbreaking agricultural strategies that overall gave rise to the asian green revolution', 'these centers arent names known to everyone but they deserve to be', 'his scientific breakthroughs helped feed the world and well need more like them', 'dozens of countries with low income and food shortages perhaps up to 4050 have developed urgent programs for increased food production by smallholder farmers but are currently prevented by a lack of donor funding', 'these countries turned to the world bank for funding and the bank made a valuable help effort in 2008 through its global food crisis response program gfcrp as it stands in english', 'but the bank still doesnt have enough money to meet the urgent needs of these countries and it had to ration aid to a small fraction of the flows that can be used effectively and dependably', 'hundreds of millions of people in the meantime are still trapped in hunger', 'many individual donor countries said they are already in a position to increase their financial support for smallholder agriculture but they are looking for the appropriate means to do so', 'the current aid structure is inadequate', 'the more than 20 bilateral and multilateral donor agencies for agriculture are very piecemeal and have an insufficient scale at both the individual and the collective levels', 'despite the dedicated efforts of many professionals the response to the hunger crisis remains totally inadequate', 'the 2008 planting seasons arrived and went with little additional help for the poor small farmers', 'african countries seek endlessly and most of the time unsuccessfully the small finance needed for their purchases of improved fertilizers and seeds', 'as members of the advisory committee for the spanish initiative my colleagues and i recommend that donors pool their funds into a single international account which we call the financial coordination mechanism', 'these funds as a whole would allow farmers in poor countries to obtain the fertilizers improved seed varieties and the smallscale irrigation equipment they urgently need', 'poor countries would receive fast and predictable funding for singleaccount agricultural inputs not dozens of different and piecemeal donors', 'by pooling financial resources into a single donor the financial coordination mechanism could keep the administrative costs of aid programmes low could assure the availability of aid flows and poor countries would not have to negotiate 25 times to receive aid', 'the time for doing business as usual ended', 'the donors promised to double aid to africa by 2010 but are still very late', 'in fact in the last 20 years aid for agricultural programs actually came down and just now its changing the course of action', 'in the meantime one billion people starve every day', 'we need a breakthrough that is proven public clear and convincing that can move peoples hearts and minds and that can prove successful', 'in madrid history can be made at the end of january when the richest and poorest countries in the world come together in search of solutions to the world hunger crisis', 'the lives of the worlds poorest billion people depend on it', 'an outstanding opportunity for overall health', 'millions of people die each year from preventable and treatable diseases especially in poor countries', 'in many cases cheap lifesaving drugs can be produced on a large scale but their selling prices prevent people from buying them', 'in addition there are many who die simply because there are no cures or vaccinations because very few resources and research talent around the world are devoted to dealing with diseases in the poor', 'this situation represents a failure of the economy and the law that has to be corrected urgently', 'the good news is that there are new opportunities for change now especially through international efforts led by the world health organization that would begin to change the ineffective intellectual property regime that is hampering the development and availability of affordable drugs', 'there are two main problems that are now limiting access to drugs', 'one is that they are very expensive or rather the assigned price is too high even though the cost of producing them is just a fraction of that price', 'second the development of drugs is aimed at maximum economic not social benefit which biases efforts aimed at the development of drugs that are essential to the welfare of mankind', 'since poor people have little money to spend drug companies under current regulations have very little incentive to conduct research into diseases that affect the poor', 'this situation doesnt have to prevail', 'drug companies claim that high prices are necessary to finance research and development', 'however in the united states the government is the one that funds much of the research and development on health issues directly through government support national health institutions or the national science trust and indirectly through public drug acquisitions by the medicare and medicaid programs', 'even the part that doesnt receive government funds isnt a conventional market most individual prescription drug purchases are covered by insurance', 'the government funds research into health services because improved drugs are a common good', 'new knowledge benefits everyone because it puts an end to epidemics and limits the economic and human losses caused by the spread of diseases', 'efficiency is achieved through the sharing of research as wide as possible and as soon as it becomes available', 'thomas jefferson said that knowledge was like candles when one is used to light another one does not dim the light from the first one', 'on the contrary everything becomes brighter', 'however in the united states and much of the world drug prices remain exorbitant and the spread of knowledge is extremely limited', 'this is because we have created a system of patents that gives the innovators a temporary monopoly on their invention which incentivizes them to hoard their knowledge so that they dont benefit their competitors', 'while this system offers incentives for certain types of research because it makes innovation profitable it also allows drug companies to raise prices and the incentives dont necessarily correspond to social gains', 'in the health sector more income can be gained through research into drugs that already exist that need to develop a really effective treatment', 'the system of patenting can even have harmful effects on innovation because while the most important input in160 any research is the use of earlier ideas the system of patenting incentivizes secret', 'high prices and biased research can be solved if the current model is replaced with a governmentbacked reward system', 'a system of prizes reward the new knowledge brought by the innovators but they dont hold back the monopoly of their use', 'in this way the power of competitive markets can guarantee that a new drug will be offered at the lowest possible price not at a monopolized inflated price', 'fortunately some american lawmakers show a greater interest in this approach', 'the bill on the hivaids reward fund a bill by congress introduced by senator bernie sanders is an example of this', 'the sanders initiative has an important commitment to encouraging open research which would make the current model of research based on exchange rather than secret', 'however at the global level our innovation system needs further change', 'the whos efforts to push for substantial reforms at the international level are critical', 'this spring the who issued a report advising similar solutions to the proposals in the american senates initiative but at a global level', 'the research and development to meet health needs in developing countries report recommends a broad approach that includes mandatory government financial contributions for health needs research in developing countries international coordinating to define health service priorities and their application and a global observatories to identify where there are more needs to be addressed', 'by the end of may the international community will have the opportunity to start putting these ideas into practice at the world health assembly of the world health organization who on the one hand a moment of hope for public health around the world', 'reforming a system of innovation is not just a question of economy', 'in many cases its a matter of life and death', 'it is essential then to delink the incentives for research and development activities from the prices of drugs and to encourage a greater exchange of scientific knowledge', 'in the united states the sanders initiative marks an important breakthrough', 'for the world the whos recommendations represent a unique opportunity across a generation to remedy the atrocious longstanding healthcare inequalities and more widely to set up a model of governance for global public goods suitable for the era of globalization', 'we cant let this opportunity pass us by', 'distracted murderers', 'as a species humans have a serious problem of selfcontrol', 'nowadays we humans are fishing hunting cutting and sowing crops so aggressively all over the world that were literally driving other species off the planet', 'our intense desire to get all we can from nature leaves very little for other life forms', 'in 1992 when world governments promised to address manmade global warming they also offered to prevent humaninduced extinction of other species', 'the convention on biological diversity agreed at the rio earth summit states that biodiversity is the common interest of all mankind', 'signatories agreed to conserve biological diversity through attention to species and their habitats and to use biological resources eg forests in a sustained manner', 'in 2002 the signatories went further by committing to a significant reduction in the rate of loss of biological diversity by 2010', 'unfortunately like so many other international agreements the convention on biological diversity remains almost unknown unprovoked and unfulfilled', 'that carelessness is a tragedy for mankind', 'with very low cash outlays and perhaps no cash at all we could conserve nature and thereby protect the foundation of our own lives and means of living', 'we kill other species not because we have to do it but because were too careless to do something different', 'lets look at a couple of wellknown examples', 'some rich countries such as spain portugal australia and new zealand have fishing fleets that practice the socalled bottom crawl', 'bottomtrailers tow heavy nets over the bottom of the ocean and in so doing destroy magnificent unknown and endangered marine species', 'complex and unique ecosystems particularly underground volcanoes known as underwater mountains are torn to pieces because bottom dragging is the lowcost way to fish for a few species of deepsea fish', 'one of these species the orange clock has been fished for just a quarter of a century but its already exploded to the point of collapse', 'in many parts of the world tropical rainforests are being cut down to use as grassland and to sow food crops', 'the result is a loss of habitation and a destruction of massive species which yield a small economic gain at a huge social cost', 'after cutting a piece of rainforest soils often lose their nutrients quickly so they cant support crops or nutritious grasses for cattle', 'as a result new grassland and sowing land are abandoned with no prospects for the original rainforest and its unique ecosystems to be reclaimed', 'since the costs of these activities are so high and their profits so low it would be easy to break them down', 'bottom dragging should be prohibited simply it would be easy and cheap to make up for the fishing industry during the transition to other activities', 'on the other hand perhaps the best way to stop logging is with economic incentives possibly combined with regulatory limits', 'restricting just the practice of logging might not work since farmer families and communities would be strongly tempted to avoid legal limits', 'on the other hand economic incentives would probably work because cutting forests to create grazing land is not profitable enough to induce farmers to give up receiving payments for land protection', 'many countries with rainforests have come together in recent years to suggest that rich countries set up a rainforest conservation fund to pay poor small farmers a little money to conserve the rainforest', 'a welldesigned fund could slow down or stop deforestation conserve biodiversity and reduce carbon dioxide from the burning of cut forests', 'at the same time small farmers would receive a steady flow of income which they could use in microinvestments to improve their household wealth education and health', 'apart from prohibiting bottomtraceping and setting up a global fund to avoid deforestation we should designate a global network of marine protected areas where fishing sailing pollution dredging and perforating among other harmful activities are prohibited', 'such areas would not only allow species to breed but would also provide environmental benefits that would extend to neighboring unprotected areas', 'we also need a regular scientific process that will show the world evidence of the species wealth and extinction just like the process we currently have in the case of climate change', 'politicians dont listen very well to scientists who speak to each other but they are forced to listen when hundreds of scientists speak in one voice', 'finally the world should negotiate a new framework by 2010 to slow down humanmade climate change', 'there is little doubt that climate change creates one of the greatest risks to species viability', 'as the planet warms up and the pattern of rains and storms changes dramatically many species will find themselves in climate zones that can no longer stand their survival', 'some may migrate but others like polar bears are likely to die out unless we take vigorous action to avoid climate change', 'these measures can be achieved by 2010', 'theyre affordable and in each case theyd ultimately yield significant net gains', 'most important they would allow us to fulfill a global promise', 'its very painful to believe that man could destroy millions of other species and risk our own future in a diversion attack', 'dealing with them with more', 'in the united states only three out of ten workers are needed to produce and deliver the products we consume', 'everything we extract grow design build manufacture and carry until we make a cup of coffee in a restaurants kitchen and bring it to the customers table is the work of about 30 percent of the workforce', 'the rest of us plan on whats going to be done decide where to install the things thatve been made provide personal services talk to each other and follow up on whats being done so we can decide what needs to be done next', 'however in spite of our evident ability to produce much more than we need we dont seem to have an excess of wealth', 'one of the great paradoxes of our time is that middleclass workers and homes continue to battle in moments of unrivalled wealth', 'we in developed countries have more than enough to meet our basic needs', 'we have enough organic links of carbon and hydrogen that when we break up give us calories enough vitamins and other nutrients to keep us healthy adequate housing to keep us dry enough clothes to keep us warm enough capital to keep us productive at least potentially and enough entertainment to keep us from boring', 'and we produce all that on average less than two hours of work away from home every day', 'john maynard keynes made no mistake by far when in 1930 he made his famous prediction that the economic problem of the human race the struggle for survival would probably solve or at least be solved in a hundred years', 'maybe a generation is missing for robots to take full charge of manufacture cooking and construction and the developing world seems to be 50 years behind', 'but keynes would have been right if he had aimed his essay at the greatgrandchildren of his readers', 'however there are few signs that workingclass americans and middleclass americans will live better than 35 years ago', 'whats strange is that the growth in productivity doesnt seem to be increasing as you might expect in fact according to research by john fernald and bing wang economists at the department of economic research at the federal reserve bank of san francisco are slowing down', 'the prospects for growth are even worse as innovation faces strong winds against it', 'one way to balance changes in the labor market with our lived experiences and statistics like this is to realize that what were producing is very different from what weve done in the past', 'for much of our experience much of what weve produced couldnt be shared or used without permission', 'the goods produced were as some economists pointed out rival and excluding goods', 'in this context rival means that two people cant use the same product at the same time', 'excluding also means that the owner of a product can easily prevent others from using it', 'these two features have great influence on those who control production and distribution and in this way they become ideal products for the privately owned market economy', 'money flows naturally to the source of value and utility and it is easy to trace such flows in national accounts', 'however much of what were producing in the information age is neither exclusive nor rival and this changes the whole picture', 'its difficult to create incentives for creating goods in the information age its difficult to monetize their distribution and we dont have the tools to easily trace them on national accounts', 'the result is a growing difference between what people would be willing to pay for a certain service and the growth measured in national statistics', 'in other words were producing and consuming much more than our economic indicators suggest and the originators of many of those products arent getting adequate reward', 'this causes a series of unique problems', 'to guarantee that present and future workers will be able to reap the benefits of the information age will require a redefinition of our economic system in order to spur the development of these new kinds of goods', 'in addition to developing methods of accounting for this new type of wealth we will have to devise channels for making the demand for a product contribute to the source of income for its originator', 'only by means of procedures that add real value to the goods we produce will we be able to support a middleclass society instead of one composed of technoplutocrats and their servants in the service sector', 'contaminators must pay', 'when in 2010 bp and its oil rig partners caused the deepwater horizon spill in the gulf of mexico the us government asked that company to finance the cleanup pay damages to those who had been injured and pay criminal punishment for the rapes that caused the disaster', 'bp has already committed more than 20 billion in relief and punishment', 'according to the settlement held last week he will pay the greatest criminal penalty in american history us4 500 million', 'the same environmental cleanup approach should apply to multicountry companies that operate in poorer countries where their power has often been so great compared to that of governments that many act with impunity and wreak damage on the environment without being held accountable or not enough', 'when we enter an era of sustainable development impunity must become a responsibility', 'contaminators must pay both in rich and poor countries', 'large companies must accept responsibility for their actions', 'the case of nigeria has been a perfect proof of business environmental impunity', 'for decades major oil companies including shell exxonmobil and chevron have been producing oil in the niger delta a fragile environment made up of rainforests in freshwater swamps mangroves lowland rainforests and riparian island barriers', 'that rich habitat maintains remarkable biological diversity or so it was before oil companies arrived there and more than 30 million local inhabitants who depend on local ecosystems for their health and means of living', 'twenty years ago the international union for the conservation of nature and natural resources classified the hangover of the niger as a region with great biological diversity of marine and coastal flora and fauna including species of trees fish birds and mammals giving it a top priority for its preservation', 'however he noted that the biological diversity of that region was greatly threatened and with little or no protection', 'multinational companies active in the hangover have spilled oil and caused natural gas to be flamed for decades regardless of the natural environment and the impoverished and poisoned communities for their actions', 'it is estimated that the spills accumulated over the last fifty years represent about ten million barrels twice as much as bp spills', 'the data isnt safe there have been many thousands of spills during that period often poorly documented and with their gravity hidden or simply not gauged by companies or the state', 'in fact just as bp was being sentenced to new criminal punishment exxonmobil announced another leak in a pipeline from the nigers delta', 'the destruction of the hangovers environment is part of a long history corrupt companies acting according to corrupt government officials', 'businesses usually bribe officials to get oil deals lie about production avoid taxes and avoid responsibility for the environmental damage they cause', 'nigerian officials have become fabulously rich thanks to the decades of payments by international companies that have plundered the natural wealth of the hangover', 'shell the largest dealership in the nigers delta has been criticized over and over again for her abhorrent procedures and her unwillingness to take responsibility for them', 'in the meantime the local population has been impoverished and harassed by serious diseases caused by a polluted atmosphere poisoned drinking water and pollution of the food chain', 'the absence of the rule of law has led to gang wars and illegal pipeline boreholes to steal oil causing huge and frequent spills that kill dozens of people including people who were around by chance', 'in the colonial era the official aim of the imperial power was to extract the wealth from the administered territories', 'in the postcolonial period the methods are better disguised', 'when oil companies commit crimes in nigeria or in other countries they are protected by the powers of the countries in their headquarters', 'no one should interfere in the affairs of those companies say the united states and europe', 'in fact one of the biggest bribes seemingly 180 million paid recently in nigeria was halliburton a company closely related to the political power of the united states', 'dick cheney went from halliburtons executive director to us vice president', 'last year the united nations environment programme unep published a remarkable report on ogoniland an important ethnic territory in the niger that has been at the center of the conflict between local communities and international oil', 'the report was as harsh as it was scientificly clear', 'despite numerous promises made in the past about cleanup ogoniland an impoverished country victim of diseases caused by the oil industry is still suffering from environmental agony', 'unep has also provided clear and detailed recommendations including emergency measures to guarantee safe drinking water cleaning activities in mangroves and floors public health studies to discover and address the consequences of pollution and a new regulatory framework', 'the governments of the world have recently agreed to adopt a new framework for sustainable development stating their intention to adopt the goals of sustainable development at the rio  20 summit last june', 'those goals provide a critical opportunity for the world to set clear and binding rules for the behavior of governments and businesses', 'many major companies including those in the oil industry have expressed their willingness to support the goals of sustainable development', 'the clearing of the nigers hangover would be the best possible example of a new era of accountability', 'shell chevron exxonmobil and other big oil companies must take the lead and help finance the necessary cleanup starting a new era of responsibility', 'the nigerian governments own responsibility is under suspicion', 'it is encouraging that several nigerian senators have recently been at the forefront of efforts to strengthen the rule of law in the oil sector', 'the clearing of the nigers hangover affords an opportunity for the oil industry the oil industry and the international community to convincingly prove that a new era has begun', 'in the future sustainable development must not be a mere motto but an operative approach to global governance and wellbeing on a planet that is crowded and approaching the edge', 'lets not forget the death camps in sri lanka', 'one of the worst outrages in recent decades has received very little worldwide attention', 'we remember and recognize that the cases of cambodia rwanda bosnia and darfur were embarrassing', 'we tortured ourselves for the failure to stop the outrages that are being committed almost every day in syria', 'however at least so far the world has paid very little attention to war crimes and crimes against humanity which are comparable in terms of brutality to any of the above the death camps in sri lanka in 2009', 'three years ago during the bloody end of the sri lankan governments war against the separatist liberation tigers of the tamil eelam ltte movement about 300000 civilians were caught between the advance of the army and the latest ltte fighters in what has been called the cage — a small strip of land not much larger than new yorks central park between the sea and the lagoon in the northeastern part of the country', 'because of the lack of compassion and moderation on both sides at least 10000 civilians perhaps up to 40000 were killed in the mass murder that took place as a result of the armys indiscriminate bombing rebel gunfire and the deprivation of food and medicine supplies', 'the lack of anger mainly reflects the success of the sri lankan government in inculcating in policymakers and the public an alternative narrative that had an extraordinary worldwide resounding after the september 2001 terrorist attacks', 'what happened in the cage according to this narrative was the longawaited defeat by completely necessary and justiciable means of a murderous terrorist revolt that had threatened the very existence of the country', 'the other key reason for the global silence is that the sri lankan government inflexibly prevented independent watchers whether media nongovernmental or diplomatic from watching or informing on their actions', 'the shyness of the united nations staff in the country to communicate the information they had made this problem worse', 'president mahinda rajapaksas government claimed all along and still does that it maintained a policy of zero civilian casualties', 'the officials claimed that no heavy artillery fire was directed against civilians or hospitals that any side damage against civilians was minor and that they fully respected international law including the ban on the execution of prisoners', 'several recent papers however are tearing up that narrative mainly the report submitted last year by a group of united nations experts as well as two books the unrelenting analysis by a united nations official gordon weiss the cage the fight for sri lanka and the last days of the tamil tigers and the heartbreaking story by the bbc journalist frances harrison still counting the dead survivors of sri lankas hiden war', 'nobody underestimates the lttes contribution to the 2009 killing but now that all the tiger leaders are dead international attention should focus mainly on holding the government accountable for failing to accept its responsibility to protect its own people', 'for a long time the government of rajapaska has been avoiding responsibility with a number of diversionary manoeuvrings often consisting of investigation boards set up with the aim of not getting results and meeting that goal properly refusal of physical access open lies and ceaseless verbal bullying against anyone who dares to question it', 'at last there is real international pressure on the government to explain its actions mainly through the much criticized united nations human rights council based in geneva which will study sri lankas response in march 2013', 'when i do that im likely to have a full record of evidence for war crimes and crimes against humanity thats now being compiled from testimony collected by the australiabased international crime evidence project', 'one of the most tragic aspects of the situation which is just now being made known is that the united nations officials in the country didnt publish at that time when it really mattered credible information that would have denied the governments version', 'since the beginning of 2009 a united nations team in colombo collected specific estimates of deaths in the combat zone on the basis of regular radio contacts with some reliable sources united nations nongovernmental organizations doctors and local tamil officials who were still on the ground', 'the information was incomplete but solid and startling', 'however the institutional decision was made not to use it on the grounds that it could not be “verified”', 'the real reasons are coming up now', 'the united nations team wanted to keep humanitarian channels open', 'the team was also subject to shameless verbal harassment by officials in sri lanka a deeply unpleasant experience that i too have experienced', 'the team members also knew that the government of sri lanka had broad support from the member states of the united nations and that the ltte didnt have the slightest support', 'however as the lakhdar brahimi panel concluded ten years ago after discussing some of the catastrophic failures of the peace process of the 1990s the united nations secretariat has a responsibility to report to the security council what it needs to know not what it wants to know', 'an internal panel appointed by secretarygeneral ban kimoon and headed by the distinguished diplomat charles petrie is scheduled to report next month to discuss the flaws in the united nations system response in sri lanka', 'all seems to indicate that the conclusions wont be pleasant', 'it is very important that these conclusions be published and that action be taken on them', 'selective memory is a defense tool that we all know', 'it is easier for governments and international organizations as for individuals to live with moral failure if it is claimed that it never existed', 'however in sri lanka there were indeed mass outrages widespread moral abuses and if we dont learn from this past well be bound to repeat it', 'answer for gaza', 'this week the united nations human rights council will discuss the report of the factfinding mission led by judge richard goldstone on human rights abuses in the conflict in gaza', 'lets hope its a thorough and fair examination of his conclusions and recommendations', 'both israel and the palestinian group that controls gaza have committed war crimes and possibly crimes against humanity during the period of the conflict covered by the investigation the report calls for credible investigations into the alleged human rights abuses and recommends that the un security council request both sides to turn up counterreports within six months of the delivery of the results including any legal action they may take in connection with the identified abuses', 'in the opinion of the goldstone committee if they dont do that the security council should refer the matter to the public prosecutor of the international criminal tribunal in the hague', 'unfortunately instead of discussing the detailed conclusions that goldstone has presented and the credit for his recommendations on the steps to be taken there are signs that governments may end up focusing on the process leading up to the investigation and seeking to limit their full debate', 'as a participating in this process i feel it is important to put my opinions on it in writing as some of my comments are being used as part of the attempts to debunk judge goldstone and his important work', 'i refused to accept the invitation of the president of the human rights council at that time ambassador martin umoibhi of nigeria to head the investigation after the human rights councils 12 january 2009 resolution as a former un high commissioner for human rights i am convinced that the councils resolution was biased and did not allow for a balanced look at the situation on the ground', 'he referred only to the serious human rights abuses in the occupied palestinian territory particularly due to the recent attacks by the israeli army and called for the setting up of a mission to investigate all the human rights law abuses by the occupying country israel against the palestinian people', 'i also knew that the un human rights council had repeatedly condemned israel over the past two years but had paid little attention to largescale human rights abuses in other countries', 'this pattern of action and inaction has given greater credit to those who believe that the highest united nations human rights body has an intrinsically antiisraelite bias', 'for those reasons i decided that i couldnt accept to head the mission', 'i know that judge goldstone a dedicated and impenetrable lawyer and human rights advocate had similar concerns when he got the initial proposal', 'however he was able to reach an agreement with the president of the council to give him confidence that the term of office would be allowed to be interpreted in a way that would allow his team to deal with the facts committed by', 'experts can discuss whether this was in accordance with the un rules and procedures', 'i have no doubt that those who participated in these talks did so in search of a way to make a thorough investigation possible and to help overcome the political divisions currently undermining the human rights council within the un system', 'the question now is whether governments will give judge goldstones conclusions the attention they deserve or else theyll fall into an overly political position', 'as goldstones report makes clear', 'both the palestinians and the israelis feel a legitimate anger over the lives they are obligated to live in for the palestinians the anger over individual events the civilian casualties the damage and destruction in gaza following the military attacks the blocking the construction of the wall beyond the 1967 limits fueled an anger behind the continued israeli occupation their daily humiliatingness and their still unfulfilled right to selfdetermination', 'for the israelis the public statements by armed groups of the palestinians carrying out rocket and mortar attacks on civilians strengthen a deep concern that the negotiations will bear little fruit and that the existence of their nation will continue to be under constant threat from which they have no choice but to protect their people', 'in this way both the israelis and the palestinians have the secret which for some is a belief that the other has no intention of accepting their right to exist as a country', 'unfortunately there are many politicians who skillfully represent this anger and fear', 'for the sake of human rights and peace in the region i hope that the international community will take these circumstances into account weigh in on judge goldstones report in its entirety and press for those who committed the most serious crimes to be held accountable for their actions', 'contabling the tricks of the world', 'countable traps will make up one of the hottest items on the bankers agenda that will come together at the imfs annual world bank meeting in washington dc the imf should do more than just give advice to the private sector on how to fix its accounting problems they should also face the government accounting tricks and the imfs own resoundings according to nobel laureate joseph stiglitz', 'the scandals of arthur anderson and enron in the united states have focused attention on the accounting problems of private businesses', 'but the scale of such corruptness shouldnt conceal the problem of public sector accounting where a lot of deceit is done as well', 'the accounting rules are designed to provide a standardized basis from which the financial position of a firm or government can be established', 'bad accounting rules always lead to poor information and bad information always leads to bad decisions which have serious longterm consequences', 'thats true for both the public and the private sector', 'enron and other companies showed how accounting rules can be twisted and abused to provide a different picture of what really happens in a company', 'to stay away the bush administration has shown how to twist accounting rules to provide a different picture of what really happens in a national economy', 'last year he testified what could be the greatest accounting fraud ever done when a megasurplus of more than three billion dollars for the period from 2002 to 2011 was transformed into a 2 billion deficit', 'enrons investors were forced to wait years before they found out something was wrong but the sudden largescale changes in americas tax stance already give the public a clear signal of the massive problems that are coming', 'as with enron it will be years before the full magnitude of president bushs deceit is apparent', 'in the meantime the bush administration will blame the missing surplus on a declining economy bad luck and unintentionally miscalculations', 'but the us is not alone in permitting official accountants to misbehave', 'in latin america and the rest of the developing world the imf imposed accounting rules that not only made little sense but also resulted in excessive austerity', 'in some of the worlds poorest countries that is those most dependent on financial aid the imf has argued that the support received should not be included as an income in the governments budget estimates', 'but what is help if it doesnt rent', 'apparently the imfs argument is this a country cant rely on foreign aid because such support is very unreliable', 'the truth is that in poor countries financial aid is more stable than tax revenues', 'according to the imfs logic neither aid nor tax revenues should be included in the budget', 'if thats the case every country in the world has serious problems', 'the absurdity of this is the idea that all foreign aid should be added to the reservations', 'but donating countries want to see how the money they give to finance schools and health care clinics actually goes to schools and health care clinics they dont want to see how it adds to a countrys reservations', 'developing country governments have the answer', 'other imf accounting practices including how capital spending is treated', 'thanks to this rule investors could see only an apparent worsening of a countrys tax position and then they could demand higher interest rates of course foreign investors like this imf logic in which government corporations are left at an obvious downside with an overt investment ability those companies cant compete in the line of acquisitions', 'another imf accounting distortion involves stabilization funds', 'these are national funds that in the years of economic power receive rents from sales of natural resources rents that will be set aside to protect themselves in the weather days', 'that makes sense', 'but imf accounting practices stifle the use of such funds to help stable an economy through countercyclical tax spending', 'according to mexican and chilean officials with whom i have discussed the matter the expense originated in the stabilization funds is according to them treated as if the country were borrowing thereby increasing its deficit', 'of course its when the economy is in bad condition that countries worry more about their credit score so the imfs position doesnt help at all', 'the imfs accounting standards rather than giving useful signals to the market provide distorted information that exacerbates the problems of countries in difficulty', 'good decisions require information', 'the euro wont prosper without centralization', 'youth unemployment in some countries of the eurozone such as spain and greece rubs 50 is this the sacrifice of a generation for a single currency that covers a group of countries too many to be sustained', 'if so will extend eurozone membership to other countries really serve the apparent european goal of maximizing economic integration without necessarily bringing about full political union', 'there is good news and it is on the question of whether europe should have a single currency that there are economic researches that can give some answers', 'the bad news is that it is becoming more and more clear that at least in the case of large countries the monetary areas are highly shaky unless they correspond to national borders', 'at the very least a monetary union requires a confederation with more centralization of tax authority and other policies than european leaders imagine for the eurozone', 'what remains of the famous conjecture proposed in 1961 by nobel prizewinner robert mundell according to which national borders dont need to be significantly overconfident with monetary ones', 'in a provocative article in the american economic review entitled a theory of optimum currency areas mundell argued that as long as workers can move within the monetary region to wherever there is work the region can do without using exchange rate adjustments as a means of balance', 'he attributed to another future nobel prizewinner james meade credit for having recognized in a previous paper the importance of labour mobility but criticized his understanding of the idea as too strict notably in the context of nascent european integration', 'although the work of mundell does not emphasize the financial crisis it is assumed that at present the mobility of the labor force is more important than ever', 'no one should be surprised if the workers leave the countries of the eurozone affected by the crisis but they dont necessarily do it to go to the more affluent countries of the north', 'portuguese workers on the other hand are escaping to rising former colonies such as brazil and macau and irish workers are trolling into canada australia and the united states', 'a flow of spanish workers is entering romania which until recently was an important source of agricultural labor for spain', 'even so if within the eurozone there was a move close to the ideal of mundell we wouldnt be seeing an unemployment rate of 25 in spain today whereas in germany it is less than 7', 'other authors later discovered other essentials that define the success of a monetary union and that are difficult to achieve without deep political integration', 'peter kenen argued at the end of the 1960s that without the damper effect of exchange rate movements currency unions need to appeal to tax transfers as a way to share risks', 'in a normal country the national tax system acts as an immense interregional automatic stabilising system', 'for example when the price of oil goes up in the united states theres an increase in revenues in texas and montana which in turn means that these states will pay more taxes to the federal coffers and thereby help the rest of the country', 'obviously europe doesnt have a significant central tax authority so this automatic stabilising machine basically doesnt exist', 'some european academics tried to show that no tax credit is needed as in the united states because whatever level of risk sharing is desired it can be achieved in theory through financial markets', 'but this claim was very wrong', 'financial markets can be fragile and offer very little ability to share risks related to workers income which accounts for most of the income of any advanced economy', 'the focus for kenen was shortterm transfers aimed at smoothing ups and downs cycles', 'but in a monetary union with huge differences in income and levels of development the short term may cover a very long period', 'nowadays many germans consider that any system of tax relief has become a permanent feeding probe very much in the style of the help that northern italy has been giving to the south during the last century', 'in fact more than 20 years after the german unification the west germans still dont know when the bills they left will run out', 'another later author maurice obstfeld pointed out that in addition to tax transfers a monetary union needs clear rules on the function of last resort lending', 'otherwise bank runs and financial panics will be on the agenda', 'obstfeld thought of a bank rescue scheme but its already become quite clear that it also takes lastinstance creditors and bankruptcy procedures for states and cities', 'a logical corollary of the criteria proposed by both kenen and obstfeld and even to the mundell labor mobility test is that monetary union cannot survive without political legitimacy which almost always involves popular choices that cover the entire region', 'european leaders cant continue to make large countrytocountry transfers indefinitely unless they have a consistent european policy framework', 'european policymakers are now often complaining that if it were not for the us financial crisis the eurozone would be doing well', 'you may be right but any financial system has to be able to cope with external disturbances even large ones', 'europe may never be an optimal monetary area by any means', 'unless a more thorough political and economic integration is achieved which will eventually not include all of the current members of the eurozone it may not be possible for the euro to reach even by the end of this decade', 'a age of chinese protests', 'the new path of the world economy', 'like it or not the world around us changes all the time', 'but recent economic trends suggest that this change may be moving their direction in a fundamental way', 'lets consider advanced economics', 'over the past two decades economic growth in those countries was driven by consumption so much so that economic activity in those countries converted 10 percentage points of gdp devoted to investment in consumption', 'as a result the share of consumption in their gdp had reached 816160 per cent in 2010']\n"

whether the government will honor its commitments under more extreme circumstances.'], ['In fact, as Carmen Reinhart and I discuss in our recent book on the history of financial crises, This Time is

Since September 11th, Saudi Arabia has felt intense pressure to explain (and explain away) its links to Osama bin Laden’s al-Qaeda terrorist network because fifteen of the nineteen plane hijackers were Saudis (indeed, the majority of prisoners held by the US at Guantanamo Bay in Cuba are said to be Saudi citizens) and Saudis are often viewed as a major source of al-Qaeda’s finances.\\xa0 Moreover, it is alleged that the Saudi government has become preoccupied with appeasing America, despite the beginning of the second Palestinian intifada, and Israel’s ongoing occupation of Palestine.'], ['At the same time, Saudi public opinion has been inflamed, mostly because of their rulers’ apparent apathy toward the plight of the Palestinian people, particularly when contrasted with Osama bin Laden’s lethal propaganda. Since the terrorist attacks of September 11th, Saudi leaders have felt pressed to accommodate public revulsion about the mistreatment of the Palestinians, but worry that doing so may even further jeopardize their now brittle relations with America.'], ['Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative provoked widespread surprise, not because the idea is so startlingly new, but because of its source and timing. A proposal for “full normalization” with Israel coming from an Islamic regime that bases its legitimacy on the austere Islamic doctrines of the Wahhabi seems both peculiar and progressive.\\xa0 But Saudi Arabia’s long-cultivated image of stability, benevolence, and mystical communal harmony has given way under the endless glare of the American press.\\xa0 Its educational system, too, is increasingly portrayed as a breeding ground for hatred of the West.\\xa0 Something had to give.'], ['America’s seemingly hostile attention gave rise to the speculation that Crown Prince Abdullah’s initiative really denotes a Saudi public relations counteroffensive, hatched in the Saudi embassy in Washington to cover over the rift with the US. Indeed, the subsequent, deafening silence by other Saudi leaders to the proposal appears to confirm it as a public relations move for which they need not risk any of their own domestic political capital.'], ['Although Abdullah is usually referred to in the West as Saudi Arabia’s ruler, the debilitated King Fahd’s six full brothers are the ones who truly represent the real power in the Kingdom. Almost nothing, neither in support nor in opposition, has been uttered by the King and these other brothers, collectively known as the “Sudairis.”'], ['The Sudairis, it seems, have apparently left their half brother alone to twist in the wind.
